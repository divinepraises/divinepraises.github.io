    "1, Podoben “The joy of the heavenly ranks…”",
    "While living on earth you were joined to the incorporeal ones,* and with them you unceasingly minister to the Trinity, O divinely blessed father.* Wherefore, ever dwelling in the Highest as a heavenly man,* you initiated them that are on earth* into the mysteries of God.",
    "O divinely blessed one,* you were shown to be a branch of the activity of Christ planted by God,* putting forth grapes of the divine Word,* whence we faithfully draw forth precious sweetness;* and with our whole heart* we offer your teaching to all the world.",
    "Illumined with divine splendour,* your body consumed by material fire,* you passed over to the immaterial radiance, O father.* Grant us remission by your prayers,* bringing light to the gloomy night of the passions of our souls,* O wise one."

  "theotokion": "Tempest-tossed on the deep of transgressions,* fleeing to the calm haven of your all-pure supplication,* I cry out to you, O Theotokos:* Save me, O all-immaculate one, extending your mighty right hand* to your servant!",
  "stavrotheotokion": "When she beheld the Lamb lifted up upon the Tree,* the immaculate Virgin cried out, weeping:* O my sweet Child, what is this new and most strange sight?* How are You, who hold all things in the palm of Your hand,* nailed in the flesh to the Tree?"
