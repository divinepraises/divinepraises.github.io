    "2, Podoben “When from the Tree…”",
    "You that love the things of God, honouring those of the Spirit,* come today and let us behold the banquet* of the sweet savour of abstinence* which Tarasius, the godly host, by his immaterial virtues,* has prepared for us in spirit.* Let us all cry out eagerly:* We entreat you, pray that we may obtain forgiveness of our sins!",
    "You revealed the faith to the whole world in truth,* wise and eminent father,* you wrote it in stone, shaking off the dirt of heresy,* establishing the beauty of the Church,* as you followed the teachings of the apostles of Christ.* Together with them we all cry out to you:* Rightly-praised father, pray that our souls may be saved!",
    "You received everything of Christ* and the blessedness of giving alms in love for the poor.* Pouring forth alms upon them richly,* you received the mercy of the promise,* for mercy will cry out to be praised at the judgment.* Therefore you departed to life!* We beseech you, pray that we may obtain forgiveness of our sins!"

  "theotokion": "You alone bore in your womb, without confining Him, the uncontainable God,* who in His goodness became a man, O all-holy Bride of God.* Therefore, I beseech you: set me free of the passions which confine me,* that, walking the straight and narrow path,* I may reach that which leads to life, O Virgin.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "As you beheld the all-ripe Cluster of grapes,* which you bore in your womb without cultivation, O pure one,* hanging on the Tree, lamenting you exclaimed and cried out:* 'O Child, let fall the sweetness whereby all the drunkenness of the passions is abolished,* entreated by Your own lovingkindness,* for the sake of me who bore You, O Benefactor!"
