    "4, Podoben “As one valiant among the martyrs…”",
    "Wisely, O most wise one, you taught the incorporeal Word* who is equally unoriginate with the Father* and who united Himself hypostatically to the flesh;* whose activity is twofold,* through both the natures of which He is comprised and in which He is seen:* One, indivisible in essence,* and comprehended as existing in both.",
    "Having studied the law of the Lord,* O blessed and holy hierarch Meletius,* you showed yourself to be a tree* standing by the waters of asceticism, as it is written,* and bringing forth the fruits of the virtues* through the grace of Him who sanctified your holy soul* and made of you a receptacle of all spiritual effulgence.",
    "As say the Scriptures,* your cheeks were adorned like turtle-doves, O most wise one Meletius,* loving abstinence and forgoing food,* desiring the noetic sustenance which Christ bestowed upon you* when you undertook your manifold labours,* displaying the ardent zeal which you showed when suffering misfortunes* for the sake of the Faith."

  "theotokion": "As your prayer to the Lord is untiring* and your entreaty abiding, O all-pure one,* quell the assaults and still the waves of my wretched soul;* calm my heart, which is in suffering,* I beseech you, O Maiden,* and impart grace to my mind,* that I may worthily glorify you.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "When the ewe-lamb, who gave birth to You,* saw You, the Lamb and Shepherd, upon the Tree,* she lamented and cried out to You maternally:* O my Son most desired!* How is it that You are suspended upon the Tree of the Cross, O Long-suffering One?* How have Your hands and feet been pierced with nails by the iniquitous, O Word?* And how have You shed Your blood, O Master?"
