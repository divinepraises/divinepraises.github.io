    "8, Podoben “O most glorious wonder…”",
    "O venerable father Porphyrius,* taking the Cross of Christ upon your shoulder* you abandoned all and attained to the desert,* and did battle with the ruler of this world,* armed with fasting and prayers.* Wherefore, as a temple of the Spirit of God,* you cast him down together with carnal mindedness.",
    "As of old God saved the three youths from the fire by His angel,* so now by you has He saved three youths that had been dragged down into a pit;* for when they were borne as in a basket* He overshadowed them with the light of a cloud* which formed three crosses on their bodies* to the reproof of them that opposed you, O Porphyrius.",
    "Who can worthily hymn your temptations and pangs,* your misfortunes and tribulations, your struggles for the faith, O Porphyrius?* For you showed the boldness which you have before God to be great.* Wherefore, we entreat you, for you have such boldness:* Pray in our behalf to the Lord, that we be saved!"

  "theotokion": "The pre-eternal God, taking flesh of your blood,* has shown you forth, as an intercessor for men, O pure one.* Wherefore, deliver your servants from all misfortune and every evil circumstance,* and vouchsafe that all that glorify and bow down before you* be accounted worthy of the splendour of the elect.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "Beholding You nailed to the Cross* and voluntarily accepting suffering, O Jesus,* Your Virgin Mother, O Master, cried aloud:* Woe is me, my sweet Child!* How is it that You endure wounds unjustly inflicted,* O Physician who heals human infirmities,* and has delivered all from corruption in Your lovingkindness?"
