    "With the light of his discourse, Archippus illumined the people* and delivered them from the darkness of unbelief;* and having suffered and trampled down the enemy,* he made haste to the never-waning Radiance and rejoices now with the angels.* Through his prayers, O Master, bestow great mercy upon all.",
    "Dragged along, pierced through,* and beset by all manner of other cruel tortures, O blessed one,* you did not deny Christ, nor did you render worship to graven images.* Therefore, you received a crown, and pray that great mercy be granted to all.",
    "With the divine streams of your blood* you sanctified the earth, O divinely wise martyr;* by your wounds you wounded a multitude of evil demons,* and, ever pouring forth healings, you heal the most grievous of sufferings.* Therefore, in your supplications, O blessed one, ask that all receive great mercy."

  "theotokion": "O Mistress, rescue me from the hands of the serpent* who slays mankind, and who wishes to devour me utterly in his wickedness.* Crush his jaws, I pray you, and destroy his snares;* that, delivered from his talons, I may magnify your aid.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "“I cannot bear to see You, my Child, who gives courage to all,* asleep upon the Tree,* that You may give divine and saving courage* to those who have fallen into the sleep of sin* by eating of the fruit of transgression long ago,”* said the Virgin, weeping, whom we magnify."
