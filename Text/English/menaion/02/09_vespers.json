    "2, Podoben “When from the Tree…”",
    "Submitting to the laws of Him who, for our sake, assumed our flesh on earth* and endured His honoured Passion, O divinely blessed one,* you showed love for your neighbour,* which is the epitome of the law and the prophets.* Wherefore, you received a blessed end, O Nicephorus,* and stand now before the Wellspring of love.",
    "You bend your neck to God, before whom all knees do bend, O wondrous martyr;* your head is severed and parted from your comely body,* and with your most honoured mind you are united to Christ, the Head of all.* And now drawing close to His light, O Nicephorus,* beseech enlightenment for us who praise you.",
    "You have sanctified the earth with the streams of your blood shed for Christ, O martyr,* and by your spirit you have gladdened the spirits of the incorporeal hosts,* and have enlightened the whole flock of the martyrs, O blessed one,* united with them as a valiant warrior and an invincible martyr;* and you pray to God in our behalf.",

    "O athlete Nicephorus, you have clearly shown to all* that he who loves not his neighbour cannot love the Master;* wherefore, in purity you loved your own neighbour Sapricius.* Hence, you took wing to divine Desire,* and lay down your life in confession of Christ and the Faith.* But Sapricius of ill repute,* having conceived for you an implacable hatred,* showed himself also a betrayer of Christ the Master.* Standing now before Him, pray that our souls be saved."

  "stavrotheotokion": "O all-pure Mistress, a sword pierced your heart, as Symeon said,* when you beheld Him who shone forth from you in manner past recounting* lifted up on the Cross by the iniquitous as One condemned,* given vinegar and gall to drink, His side pierced,* His hands and feet run through with nails;* and, lamenting, you exclaimed, crying out maternally:* “What is this new mystery, O my Child most sweet?”"
