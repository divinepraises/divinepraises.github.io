    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "Desiring a blessedness which is past understanding,* you reckoned abstinence to be food, poverty to be wealth,* lack of acquisitiveness to be abundant possessions,* and humility to be glory, O wondrous one.* Wherefore, you also received your desire in accordance with your understanding,* abiding in the tabernacles of the saints, O Basil.",
    "You completed the immutable course of abstinence, and kept the Faith.* Wherefore, you have been adorned with a crown of righteousness, O father,* which Christ has prepared for you,* awarding you recompense in accordance with your merits,* and bestowing upon you honours and rewards for your pangs.* Beseech Him, O divinely inspired one, that He save our souls.",
    "You cast off all love of pleasure which enslaved your body, O divinely wise one,* harrowing your senses with the pangs of abstinence,* with terrible living conditions, the endurance of temptations,* and the withstanding of evil circumstances;* and thereby you have received never-ending delight,* everlasting sweetness and ineffable joy."

  "theotokion": "Take pity, O Mistress, upon me who am brought low by the assaults of the demons,* and have been cast down into the pit of destruction;* and set me firmly upon the rock of the virtues,* fending off the attacks of the enemy.* Vouchsafe that I may obey the commandments of your Son and our God,* that I may receive remission on the Day of Judgment.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "Beholding Christ, who loves mankind, crucified, His side pierced by a spear,* the all-pure one cried out, weeping:* “What is this, O my Son?* What have the thankless people done to You in return for the good You have done for them?* You make haste to leave me childless, O most Loving One.* I marvel at Your voluntary crucifixion, O Compassionate One!”"
