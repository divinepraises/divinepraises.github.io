    "What shall we name you, O divinely inspired one?* Head of the Orthodox Church of Christ?* Eye of piety, possessed of the spiritual understanding* to see clearly the hearts of men,* and pouring forth the word of life upon all the ends of the earth?* Divinely inscribed scroll of the right Faith?* Pray that our souls be saved.",
    "What now shall we call you, O wondrous one?* Preacher of the Truth, firm foundation?* Senior among the honoured supreme council?* Excellent rule of doctrines, possessing the measure of correction?* The one who cut down the division of Nestorius and the confusion of Eutyches* with divinely wrought revelations?",
    "What now shall we call you, O marvellous one?* Prince and ruler, splendidly exercising spiritual mastery over the passions of the body?* Vessel of divine mercy, habitation of perfect love?* Loving pastor awaiting the repentance of sinners?* Pray that our souls be saved."

  "theotokion": "Whom have you emulated, O wretched soul,* who in no wise rouse yourself to repentance* nor fear the fire which awaits the wicked?* Arise, and cry out,* calling upon her who alone is quick to help:* O Virgin Mother, entreat your Son and our God,* to deliver me from the snare of the deceiver!",
  "stavrotheotokion": "The ewe-lamb, when she saw the Lamb* outstretched of His own will upon the Tree of the Cross,* cried out maternally, weeping in her pain:* “O my Son, what is this strange sight that I see?* How is it that You who, as Lord, give life to all,* dies, O Longsuffering One, bestowing resurrection upon mortals?* I glorify Your great condescension, O my God!”"
