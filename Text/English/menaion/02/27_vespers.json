    "4, Podoben “As one valiant among the martyrs…”",
    "With most pious thought, with purity, and holiness of mind,* by restraining the passions, and by observing the commandments of Christ and piety,* O most blessed one who are most rich,* you strove to preserve the dignity of the image* which was, in the beginning,* fashioned according to the image and likeness of God.",
    "Having first undertaken ascetic endeavour,* and followed it afterwards with suffering in divinely wise manner,* in both you were well pleasing to the Creator,* who alone requires of us purity and nobility of soul.* And glorifying His advent in the flesh,* you venerated the holy image of His divine manhood.",
    "Denouncing, O venerable one,* those who wickedly rejected the incarnation of the Word,* you perfected the truth, upholding it by enduring wounds and all manner of afflictions,* by your fetters and imprisonment;* wherefore, you became an heir to the kingdom of Christ,* to ineffable joy and everlasting radiance."

  "theotokion": "As you have untiring supplication* and abiding entreaty before God, O all-pure one,* quell the temptations and still the waves of my wretched soul;* calm my heart, which is afflicted, I beseech you, O Maiden,* and bring grace to my mind,* that I may glorify you as is meet.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "As she beheld You, the Lamb and Shepherd, upon the Tree,* the ewe-lamb who gave birth to You lamented* and exclaimed to You maternally:* “O most desired and long-suffering Son,* how is it that You are suspended upon the Tree of the Cross?* How is it that Your hands and feet have been pierced with nails by the iniquitous, O Word?* How is it that You have shed Your blood, O Master?”"
