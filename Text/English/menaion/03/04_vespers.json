    "O divinely wise father Gerasimus,* uniting yourself unto God through prayer, supplication and great abstinence,* you remained impervious to the designs of the foe,* and showed yourself a servant of the Almighty.* Hence, we honour you, and faithfully celebrating your divine memory with great joy,* we praise you.",
    "O venerable father Gerasimus, ever abiding in faith,* in deserts, caves and mountains, you sought God.* And you found Him as you desired.* Ever strengthened with steadfast soul and good ascents,* you lead multitudes of saved monastics to God.",
    "Submitting to the behest of God who beholds all things,* you received the grace from Him to work miracles and to drive away wicked spirits,* and to tame wild beasts by the purity of your mind.* Wherefore, we honour you, and as is meet we celebrate with faith your divine memory,* O divinely blessed one."

  "stavrotheotokion": "Beholding You, O Jesus, nailed to the Cross* and accepting suffering of Your own will, O Master,* the Virgin, Your Mother cried aloud:* Woe is me, O my sweet Child!* How is it that You endure wounds unjustly inflicted,* O You that heal human infirmities* and deliver all from corruption in Your lovingkindness?"
