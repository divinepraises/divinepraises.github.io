    "4, Podoben “As one valiant among the martyrs…”",
    "A most sacred priest, the foundation of the Church,* you were shown to be an unshakable pillar, O most glorious one,* and a wonderworker most true, bestowed of God, O glorious one;* and you were a most radiant and sacred luminary and a garden of paradise,* having acquired Jesus the Bestower of life as the Tree of life in your midst,* O hieromartyr Theodotus. ",
    "Beaten with leathern thongs, and stretched out on a tree,* and bitterly lacerated, O right wondrous one,* imprisoned in a dungeon, your feet cruelly pierced with nails,* and laid upon a heated bed of iron,* you were shown to be steadfast,* glorifying Him who strengthened you amid all your torments,* O hieromartyr Theodotus.",
    "Strangling the enemy with the cords of your struggles, you vanquished his power;* and having been most splendidly courageous,* you dwelled as a crowned victor in the kingdom of heaven,* having been accounted worthy of enlightenment* and the comeliness of them that hold festival;* and you pray that they that honour you be saved,* O Theodotus, glory of the martyrs."

  "theotokion": "Deliver my soul from condemnation and grievous transgressions, O all-holy Bride of God,* and rescue it from death by your supplications.* Grant that on the day of trial I may receive the justification* which the assemblies of the saints have received;* and before the end show me forth as cleansed through repentance* and by the shedding of tears.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "As she beheld You nailed to the Cross, O Lord,* the ewe-lamb, Your Mother, marvelled and cried out:* “What is this that I see, O my Son most desired?* How have You been rewarded by the unfaithful and iniquitous assembly* which has enjoyed Your many miracles?* Yet glory to Your ineffable condescension, O Master!”"
