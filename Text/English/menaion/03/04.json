    "<i>(Tone 2)</i> Living a life angelic in fasting and powerful in prayer,* a life unwavering in trials, unceasing in vigil, and temperate in all things,* you astonished the angels and vanquished the legions of devils, O father Gerasimos.* You gladden the hearts of the faithful, O blessed saint.* The beasts were obedient to you for all of this.* Since you have achieved a place of honor before the Lord,* pray for the salvation of our souls."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Inflamed with an exalted ideal,* you preferred Jordan severity to worldly delights.* Until the day you died, the wild animals listened to you;* and they died of sorrow upon your grave, O father.* Truly they praised you before God.* Pray to Him, O father Gerasimos, and keep us in your holy memory."
