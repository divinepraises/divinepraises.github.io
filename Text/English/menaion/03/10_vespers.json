    "1, Podoben “The joy of the heavenly ranks…”",
    "Let us in faith raise a magnificent song as is fitting* to the all-praised Codratus and the great Cyprian,* with the two named Dionysius and Anectus,* together with Crescens and the glorious Paul!* They are divinely crowned athletes of the Lord* and our most fervent intercessors!",
    "Today another choir of holy martyrs appears: victorious and triumphant!* A brilliant assembly of divine passion-bearers,* a steadfast regiment, a chosen army!* Codratus is its captain.* He is revealed as an all-glorious conqueror!",
    "All-praised Codratus, with your cutting words* you slashed through the twisted webs of the philosophers' wisdom like fog!* You taught in faith and suffered in patience for Christ.* Well-adorned in both teaching and suffering,* you have been crowned with the passion bearers!"
