    "4, Podoben “Called from on high…”",
    "Noble and victorious martyrs,* you were revealed in the final times* as unwaning stars in the Church’s honoured firmament.* You illumined all beneath the sun, all-praised ones,* with the splendour of your sufferings,* destroying the darkness of deception!* Therefore we celebrate your radiant and sacred suffering in faith,* enriched by your intercession.",
    "Martyrs of Christ,* you were bound after a summary arrest* and shut up in prison for a lengthy time.* You were divine preservers of the faith,* who refused to submit to his evil commands.* Therefore the infamous beast was enraged and slew you with the sword.* Now you have joyfully inherited higher things,* joining yourselves to the Kingdom,* all-glorious two and forty!",
    "Let us shout the praise of Constantine,* Basoes and Callistus,* Theodore and Theophilus,* and the rest of the divine company of athletes,* for they sacrificed themselves with joy, * electing to die for the Life of all.* Now they rest in the city of the living God,* entreating that on the day of judgment,* we may find remission of sins and complete deliverance.",
    "g",
    "2",
    "Today the Church mystically celebrates,* arrayed as in purple and fine linen,* with the garment of the blood of the new athletes!* For she has offered them up as an unblemished sacrifice,* nurtured in piety,* acceptable and well-pleasing to You, O Christ.* Therefore You show them to be victors over the evil enemy,* granting them crowns and glory;* by their supplications sending down on us great mercy!"
