    "1, Podoben “The joy of the heavenly ranks…”",
    "The streams of your wisdom, drawn from noetic clouds,* pour forth a fountain of Orthodoxy upon the world;* and we, the faithful, drawing forth sweetness from there,* turn away from the emissions of heresy* as from the bitter waters of Marah.",
    "Lying in the tomb, your most pure body did not in any way decay,* but was found to be whole, O most blessed Nicephorus;  and bearing it forth with zeal, those nurtured by Orthodoxy rejoiced,* gloriously blessing you, O divinely wise one.",
    "The Church honoured with the name of the Apostles* received you, O most blessed one,* who through your godly actions became a temple of God,* and who after your interment are again interred in sacred manner* and have buried all the fetid foolish prating of the heretics."

  "theotokion": "Tempest-tossed upon the deep of transgression,* having fled to the calm haven of your most pure supplications,* I cry out to you, O Theotokos:* stretch forth your mighty right hand to your servant,* and save me, O all-immaculate one.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "As she beheld the Lamb uplifted upon the Cross,* the unblemished Virgin cried out, weeping:* “O my sweet Child, what new and strange sight do I behold?* How is it that You who hold all things in Your hand* are nailed in the flesh to the Tree?”"
