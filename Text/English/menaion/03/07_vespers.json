    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "O fathers of heavenly mind, you were invincible martyrs,* most laudable hierarchs and beacons of the universe,* immovable pillars of the Church of God and a base for the dogmas,* instructors of the pious and destroyers of falsehood,* light-bearing guides for our souls,* fellow citizens with the angels* and champions of the Trinity.",
    "With divine discourses let the glorious Ephraim be blessed,* together with the divinely wise Basil, the great Capiton,* the godly Agathadorus, Elpidius and Aetherius,* and the glorious Eugene;* for, having lived venerably and suffered in sacred manner,* they were shown to be residents of the kingdom of heaven.",
    "Having slain carnal knowledge with feats of asceticism,* the glorious Basil raised a dead man from the dead by invoking the name of God;* and the most sacred shepherd Capito,* rejoicing while standing in the midst of the flame,* was seen to be unconsumed.* By their supplications, O You who loves mankind,* grant us the means of atonement and Your great mercy."

  "theotokion": "Take away the defilement of my passionate heart,*O most hymned Theotokos,* cleanse all the wounds and befoulment thereof which cometh from sin, O pure one,* and halt the wavering of my mind;* that I, your wretched and unprofitable servant,* may magnify you power and your great assistance.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "The pure one, beholding Christ, who loves mankind,* crucified, His side pierced by a spear, cried aloud, weeping:* “What is this, O my Son?* How have the people bereft of grace rewarded You for the good things You have done for them?* And do You make haste to leave me childless?* I marvel, O Compassionate One, at Your voluntary crucifixion!”"
