    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "Having first fasted and caused the uprisings of the flesh to wither up through abstinence,* you later set at nought the wiles of the enemy through martyrdom* and triumphed over him, O divinely blessed Eudocia.* Wherefore, Jesus, who loves mankind, the Saviour of our souls,* has crowned you for your twofold struggles.",
    "In the furrows of your heart* you received the divine seed like rich soil, O divinely blessed one,* and you truly put forth the grain of martyrdom, producing it a hundredfold.* You laid it up in noetic granaries through the power of the Spirit who transformed you* and wrought in you a greater change through grace,* O most lauded Eudocia.",
    "By your life-creating utterance you raised up the dead, O glorious Eudocia,* having first mortified the passions of your body with the pangs of abstinence.* And now you live with the martyrs in the heavens,* having completed the course of martyrdom with the help of the Spirit,* and you pray for all who hymn you with faith."

  "theotokion": "Rejoice, O beam of solar radiance, throne of the never-setting Sun,* who shone forth the ineffable Sun!* Rejoice, O mind shining with divine splendour,* flash of lightning illumining the ends of the earth, true lustre of gold.* O most comely and all-immaculate one* who has caused the unwaning Light to shine upon the faithful!",
  "stavrotheotokion": "Beholding Christ, who loves mankind,* crucified and pierced by a spear in His side,* the all-pure one cried out, weeping:* “What is this, O my Son?* How have the thankless people rewarded you* for the good things You have done for them?* And do You hasten to leave me childless, O most Beloved?* I marvel at Your voluntary crucifixion, O Compassionate One!”"
