    "8, Podoben “O most glorious wonder…”",
    "O divinely wise father Theophanes,* called the namesake of the Theophany of Christ,* you followed in His life-bearing steps,* and forsook all the beauties of life,* directing your gaze towards Him whom you desired,* O you of great renown, being deified by beauty and divine inclinations towards Him* and excellent perfections.",
    "O divinely wise father Theophanes,* abiding in affliction of flesh,* you steadfastly endured bitter exiles,* taking no pity on your body, for the sake of the precious icons, O all-praised one,* banished by the wrath of Leo;* and mocking him you made foolish his counsels and his vain thoughts* and his pernicious mind.",
    "Truly the Bestower of good things has richly granted to you rewards for your pangs:* to expel demons and to heal afflictions,* imparting power, O most blessed one,* and vouchsafing you ineffable joys* where the angelic ranks hold chorus,* gazing continually upon the countenance of the Almighty."

  "theotokion": "Rejoice, chariot of divine light,* most radiant star, and tabernacle of sanctity!* The Light has shone forth upon us from your all-pure womb,* illumining the ends of the earth* and sanctifying them with His grace!* Rejoice, beginning of salvation, O all-pure one!* Rejoice, rumour and saying awesome to them that trust in you!",
  "stavrotheotokion": "“What is this sight which my eyes behold, O Master?* You who sustain all creation, being lifted up on the Tree and dying, granting life to all!”* said the Theotokos weeping, when she beheld uplifted on the Cross* the God and man who ineffably had shone forth from her."
