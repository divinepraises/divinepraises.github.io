    "2, Podoben “When from the Tree…”",
    "Having from childhood renounced the world with true faith and love, O father,* rejoicing, you followed after the crucified Christ;* and having mortified your flesh with many feats of asceticism,* you richly received the grace of healings, to assuage diverse illnesses* and to expel evil spirits, greatly astonished.",
    "Being the adornment of monastics,* you assembled a countless multitude to hymn the Lord, O venerable Benedict,* and guided to heaven the steps of all who followed well your divine teachings* and emulated thy virtuous life, O father.* With them we honour you, rejoicing in your repose in sacred manner.",
    "Like Elijah of old, O father,* you called down rain from the skies at your supplication,* and you caused the vessel to pour forth oil,* resurrected a dead man and worked many other miracles,* to the glory of the God and Saviour of all, O venerable one.* Therefore, with love we celebrate your glorious memory, O Benedict."

  "theotokion": "O joy of all who sorrow, intercessor for the oppressed and nurturer of the hungry,* consolation of wanderers and staff of the blind,* visitation of the infirm, protection and help of them that labour, help of orphans:* You are the Mother of God Most High, O all-pure one.* Haste, we beseech you, that your servants be saved!",
  "stavrotheotokion": "The all-pure one, beholding the Creator of all who endured much vexation* and was lifted up upon the Cross, groaned, saying:* O all-hymned Lord, my Son and God,* how is it that You endure dishonour in the flesh,* desiring to honour Your creation?* Glory to Your great lovingkindness and condescension,* O You who loves mankind!"
