    "Watched over by divine guardians, you were preserved unharmed, O father Theophilactus;* and you were shown to be an unshaken pillar of the Church,* undaunted by the trials of the snares of the heretics.* And now pray, that peace and great mercy* be granted to our souls.",
    "O blessed father Theophilactus,* beholding God accessibly and visibly,* and delighting in Him through a better union,* and deified by this partaking,* rejoicing, you received the Blessed One whom alone you desired,* O most honoured hierarch,* making your abode now with the angels.",
    "Having departed the earth, O father Theophilactus,* you hastened aloft to heaven, O blessed one,* and were vouchsafed to live in the heavenly mansions,* because of the persecution which you endured for Christ.* Beseech Him now that He grant peace* and great mercy to our souls."

  "theotokion": "Heal my soul which has been grievously afflicted by evil passions,* O all-holy one who gave birth to Christ, the Healer and Saviour of all,* who has healed every wound inflicted by the devil’s malice,* and has abolished death for us.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "The Mistress, the unblemished ewe-lamb, as she beheld her Lamb upon the Cross,* bereft of form and comeliness, lamenting, said:* “Woe is me! Where has Your comeliness gone, O most Sweet One?* Where is Your splendour? Where is the brilliant grace of Your image,* O my Son most beloved?”"
