    "1, Podoben “All-gloriuos martyrs…”",
    "O martyrs three in number,* who contended mightily against those that cruelly condemned you,* and who with faith endured all manner of pangs most cruel:* you have received the kingdom on high.* Pray that God grant to our souls* peace and great mercy.",
    "With spiritual songs let us praise Eutropius, the steadfast Cleonicus and Basiliscus;* for they utterly consumed the tinder of ungodliness with fire by the grace of piety.* And now they illumine the ends of the earth with the divine radiance of fire,* like beacons most bright,* having cast all deception into darkness.",
    "When your heads were severed,* you crushed the head of the enemy under your beautiful feet, O valiant athletes,* unwavering stars, animate sacrifices,* treasures of the temple of heaven.* O glorious Eutropius, Basiliscus and Cleonicus,* beg peace for us all."

  "theotokion": "Rejoice, O pure one, O strange report!* Rejoice, holy tree of paradise, divinely planted!* Rejoice, destruction of the evil demons!* Rejoice, two-edged sword,* who cut off the head of the enemy by your strange birthgiving!* O most holy and all-immaculate one,* call us back who have gone astray.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "The unblemished ewe-lamb and Mistress,* beholding her Lamb upon the Cross, bereft of form and beauty,* said, lamenting: Woe is me!* Where has Your beauty set, O You who are most sweet?* Where is Your comeliness?* Where is the radiant grace of Your image,* O my Son most beloved?"
