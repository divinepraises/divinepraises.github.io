    "4, Podoben “As one valiant among the martyrs…”",
    "Called, O Sophronius,* the namesake of chastity by divine foreknowledge,* you were righteous and chaste in your deeds,* manly and wise, being wholly crowned with native virtues.* And you remained flourishing in both, soul and body* as a most eminent arbiter.",
    "From your theological mouth, O most blessed Sophronius,* you thundered forth the teachings of theology,* having clearly expounded the theology of the unoriginate Father,* and the co-unoriginate Son, and the equally everlasting Holy Spirit,* the Trinity in unity, and the unity in Trinity,* One God in essential identity.",
    "Wisely did you teach the Word equally unoriginate with the Father,* who, though incorporeal, united flesh to His Hypostasis* without change or confusion, O most wise one,* whose actions are two-fold, for both natures,* of which He is composed and wherein He is beheld,* being One, undivided in essence,* apprehended in the one and the other."

  "theotokion": "Bedew my mind with showers of the All-holy Spirit, O all-pure one,* who ineffably gave birth to Christ* the Drop who with His compassions washes away the countless iniquities of men;* dry up the upwelling of my passions,* and vouchsafe to  me a torrent of ever-living nourishment,* by your supplications.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "As she beheld You nailed to the Cross, O Lord,* the ewe-lamb, Your Mother, marvelled, and cried out:* What is this that I see, O my Son most desired?* Thus the disobedient and iniquitous assembly repay you* which enjoyed Your many wonders!* Yet glory to Your ineffable condescension, O Master!"
