    "4, Podoben “As one valiant among the martyrs…”",
    "The wondrous Habakkuk became wholly divine,* receiving the outpouring of the Spirit!* Seeing the dishonesty of the judges and their unjust judgment* he was displeased,* exhibiting the rightness of the justice of Christ the Master,* with divine love and burning thoughts,* enflamed with righteous anger!",
    "The honoured Habakkuk, standing on divine watch,* heard the ineffable mystery of your coming to us, O Christ!* He manifestly prophesied the preaching to come about You,* foreseeing the all-wise apostles as horses trampling the sea* of the many nations of the gentiles.",
    "Rejoicing in the Lord God, your Saviour,* divinely eloquent and glorious one,* you were filled with gladness, receiving the outpouring of heavenly radiance;* spiritually illumined with deifying light!* By your prayers deliver from perils and misfortunes* those who celebrate your most glorious memory with faith!"
