    "O Bethlehem prepare yourself;* O manger, adorn yourself as it behooves!* O ave, get ready to receive, for Truth has come, and the shadow has passed,* for God has come forth from a Virgin and appeared to mankind;* He has taken upon Himself our likeness and has deified our human nature.* Because of this, Adam is renewed together with Eve, and they cry out:* The mercy of God has appeared on earth to save our human race.",

    "A reading from the Prophecy of Micah.",
    "Thus says the Lord: But you, Bethlehem-Ephrathah, too small to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel; whose origin is from of old, from ancient times. Therefore the Lord will give them up until the time, when she who is to give birth has borne, and the rest of his brethren shall return to the children of Israel, he shall stand firm and shepherd his flock by the strength of the Lord, in the majestic name of the Lord, his God, and they shall remain, for now his greatness shall reach to the ends of the earth.",
    "A reading from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews.",
    "In times past, God spoke in partial and various ways to our ancestors through the prophets; in these last days, he spoke to us through a son, whom he made heir of all things and through whom he created the universe, who is the refulgence of his glory, the very imprint of his being, and who sustains all things by his mighty word. When he had accomplished purification from sins, he took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high, as far superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excelnt then theirs. For to which of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; this day I have begotten you?” Or again: “I will be a father to him and he shall be a son to me?” And again, when he leads the first-born into the world, he says: “Let all the angels of God worship him.” Of the angels he says: “He makes his angels winds and his ministers a fiery flame;” but of the Son: “Your throne, O God, stands forever and ever; and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom. You loved justice and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions;” and “At the beginning, O Lord, you established the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; and they will all grow old like a garment. You will roll them up like a cloak, and like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end.”",
    "A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. ",
    "Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the holy Spirit. Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly. Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home. He had no relations with her until she bore a son, and he named him Jesus."
