    "The grace of the Holy Spirit* dwelt within you, prophet of God,* making you a radiantly shining beacon with its light!* Through you, He preached to Nineveh the great things that were to come!",
    "Nahum, you were revealed to be a light-bearing cloud,* letting fall a shower of divine knowledge!* Prophet of God, you gave the city of Nineveh the judgment of God to drink,* for it was sick with impiety!",
    "You were a partaker of incorruptible glory and ineffable renown,* unutterable joy and divine sweetness!* Divinely inspired Nahum, prophet of God,* pray for us to the Master of all!"
