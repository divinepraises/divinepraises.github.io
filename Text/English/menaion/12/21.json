    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Your lamb, Juliana, O Jesus, cries in a loud voice:* “You, O my Bridegroom, I love; and, seeking You, I undergo martyrdom.* And with You I am crucified and buried in Your baptism,* and I suffer for Your sake that I may reign with You.* And I die on Your behalf that I may live in You.* Receive me as a spotless sacrifice,* sacrificed for You with love.”* Through her intercession in Your mercy save our souls.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Bethlehem, make ready, for Eden has been opened for all.* Ephrathah, be alert, for the Tree of life has blossomed forth from the Virgin in the cave.* Her womb has become a spiritual paradise* wherein the divine Fruit was planted,* and if we eat of it we shall live and not die like Adam.* Christ is coming forth to bring back to life* the likeness that had been lost in the beginning."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Because you were purified by perfect virginity,* you have put on the crown of martyrdom, O Juliana.* You heal the sick and the needy* and bring salvation to those who approach your relics.* Christ gives us divine grace and eternal life through you.",
    "<i>(Tone 2)</i> Seeing in Bethlehem wrapped in swaddling clothes* Him Who holds the whole earth in His hand* we offer fore-festive songs to the One who gave Him birth* for she rejoices as a Mother, holding in her womb the Son of God."
