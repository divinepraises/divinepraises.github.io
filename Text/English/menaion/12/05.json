  "kontakia": "<i>(Tone 8)</i> In your virtue,* O blessed Sabbas,* you offered yourself to God from childhood* as an unblemished sacrifice,* becoming a gardener* in the garden of godliness.* Thus you became the adornment of monastics,* a praiseworthy citizen of the desert.* And so we cry to you:* Rejoice, most wealthy Sabbas."
