  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> O passion-bearer, following God Who is piously hymned as the Trinity,* you dulled the idol-worshipping.* Suffering amid your martyrdom, O Barbara,* you were not frightened of the orders of the tormentor, O manly of mind,* in a loud voice unceasingly chanting* \"I worship the Trinity, the One God!\"",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Let us hymn John, the hymnographer* and the precious theologian,* the instructor and teacher of the Church,* and the opponent of the enemy;* for taking up the weapon of the Cross of the Lord,* he defended against every delusion of heresies,* and as a fervent intercessor before God* he delivers forgiveness of transgressions to all."
