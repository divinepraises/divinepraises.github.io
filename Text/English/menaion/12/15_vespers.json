    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "Having purified your soul of its passions, you became an instrument of the Holy Spirit. You received the divine and sacred anointing, making you a bishop, a guide for the people of God, and an invincible martyr for Him who suffered for us, freeing us from passion by His Passion, O venerable Eleutherius, witness for the Lord.",
    "You did not heed your body, covered with wounds and burned by fire. With unparalleled desire, you fixed your spirit on the supreme beauty of the divine Love, whose sweetness had captivated you; O Eleutherius, joy of martyrs, splendour of holy hierarchs, intercede for our souls.",
    "Seeing you fighting the good fight, she who had nobly brought you into this world was filled with desire to follow the same road. Your mother embraced you in the middle of the arena, O holy martyr, and was led to the slaughter like a lamb. Together with her, O blessed Eleutherius, we ask you to intercede for us with God our Saviour."
