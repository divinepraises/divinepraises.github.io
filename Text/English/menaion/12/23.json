    "<i>(Tone 8)</i> In you, O venerable mother Eugenia, the faithful image of God shone forth,* for you carried your cross and followed Christ.* You taught by your deeds how to spurn the body for it passes away;* and how to value the soul, for it is immortal.* Therefore, your soul is forever in happiness with the angels.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Bethlehem, make ready, for Eden has been opened for all.* Ephrathah, be alert, for the Tree of life has blossomed forth from the Virgin in the cave.* Her womb has become a spiritual paradise* wherein the divine Fruit was planted,* and if we eat of it we shall live and not die like Adam.* Christ is coming forth to bring back to life* the likeness that had been lost in the beginning."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> You left the passing glory of the world to follow Christ,* and you kept immaculate the brilliance of your soul.* O inspired martyr Eugenia, you are worthy of all praise.",
    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Today, the Virgin is on her way to the cave* where she will give birth in a manner beyond understanding* to the Word who is in all eternity.* Rejoice, therefore, O universe, when you hear it heralded.* With the angels and the shepherds, glorify Him who chose to be seen as anew born babe* while remaining God in all eternity."
