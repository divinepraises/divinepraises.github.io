    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Let us express our great admiration for Crete which brought forth these precious Christians,* pearls of Christ and offspring of martyrs, and in particular, these blessed Ten.* Although they were few, they overcame all the guile of powerful demons.* Therefore, these valiant martyrs of Christ have been crowned.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Bethlehem, make ready, for Eden has been opened for all.* Ephrathah, be alert, for the Tree of life has blossomed forth from the Virgin in the cave.* Her womb has become a spiritual paradise* wherein the divine Fruit was planted,* and if we eat of it we shall live and not die like Adam.* Christ is coming forth to bring back to life* the likeness that had been lost in the beginning."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> The noble struggle of the martyrs shines forth like the morning star* and sheds brilliant light for us on the One who was born in the cave,* to whom the Virgin has given birth without human seed.",
    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Today, the Virgin is on her way to the cave* where she will give birth in a manner beyond understanding* to the Word who is in all eternity.* Rejoice, therefore, O universe, when you hear it heralded.* With the angels and the shepherds, glorify Him who chose to be seen as a new-born babe* while remaining God in all eternity."
