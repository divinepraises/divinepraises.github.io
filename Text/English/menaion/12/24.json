    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> At that time Mary registered with the venerable Joseph in Bethlehem* since she was of the house of David.* She was with child, having conceived without seed.* When the time for her delivery drew near,* they could find no room in the inn,* but the cave seemed a joyful palace for the Queen.* Christ is born to renew the likeness that had been lost of old."

    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Today, the Virgin is on her way to the cave* where she will give birth in a manner beyond understanding* to the Word who is in all eternity.* Rejoice, therefore, O universe, when you hear it heralded.* With the angels and the shepherds, glorify Him who chose to be seen as a new-born babe* while remaining God in all eternity."
