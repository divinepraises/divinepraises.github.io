    "1, Podoben “All-gloriuos martyrs…”",
    "All-glorious Martyr Menas,* when your heels were struck,* your eyes put out and your God-speaking tongue removed,* you endured with steadfastness, looking for divine rewards.* Therefore pray that God may grant peace and great mercy to our souls!",
    "The glorious Hermogenes* desired the severing of his hands and feet.* beholding the fire, he showed forth a greater burning of heart* as he clung to his God!* Now we pray to Him that He may grant peace and great mercy to our souls!",
    "Your limbs were broken, wise saints;* You were cast into the depths of the sea!* having drowned the malice of the serpent,* you were guided by the hands of the Most High* to the calm haven of sweetness!* Therefore pray that God may grant peace and great mercy to our souls!"
