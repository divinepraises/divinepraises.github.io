  "note on sources": "Dol. and Ukrainian books have a troparion and a kontakion to st. Joseph here. In is deleted in 1950 Horologion, so Anthology does not have it. I follow the Anthology here only because I don't want to make a translation myself and happen to have no English Vasylianka on me. Also, Dol. requires 7 stychera to be sung today, I think it's a typo as odd numbers don't exist.",
