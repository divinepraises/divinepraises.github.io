    "What shall we proclaim you to be, O Daniel?* An uprooter of the passions and planter of the virtues,* a true wonderworker, an intercessor for sinners,* a most valiant exorcist of demons, a beacon radiant with piety,* a dwelling place of the Spirit and champion of the Church.* Pray that our souls be saved.",
    "What shall we name you, O Daniel?* A faster, for you subjected the passions to your mind;* a sufferer, for you endured all manner of discomfort,* lifted high above the ground on your pillar;* a most diligent athlete and a most skilled physician.* Pray that our souls be saved.",
    "What shall we now call you, O Daniel?* A model for monastics and teacher of abstinence,* an adornment of the faithful and worker of healings,* a beacon shining forth light upon them that are in darkness,* a fellow citizen of the angels, equal in honour to them,* and an inhabitant of paradise and a heavenly man.* Pray that our souls be saved."

  "stavrotheotokion": "When she beheld the Lamb stretched out upon the Tree of the Cross,* the ewe-lamb cried out maternally, weeping and in pain:* O my Son, what is this strange thing that I see?* O Longsuffering One, how is it that You die,* You who as Lord give life to all, granting resurrection to mortals?* I glorify Your great condescension, O my God!"
