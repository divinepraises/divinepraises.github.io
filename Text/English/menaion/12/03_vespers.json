    "4, Podoben “Called from on high…”",
    "As a divine prophet, herald and proclaimer of the words of God,* receiving the radiance of divine splendour in purity of mind,* you were revealed as the divinely inspired mouth of the Spirit!* You proclaim the things He revealed to you,* telling all the nations, most honoured one, * of the Kingdom of Christ and the salvation that is given to men.* Entreat Him to save and enlighten our souls!",
    "You fittingly shine forth in the vision of God,* divinely inspired one,* honoured with grace and a chief place among the prophets,* receiving the blessings of God!* Now that you have boldness towards the all good one and sympathy for us,* we honour you for having the eloquence of God,* being honourable and pleasing to him.* Never cease to pray on behalf of those who praise you in faith,* that He may deliver us from misfortunes and save our souls!",
    "You revealed Your prophet, Immortal One,* to be a living cloud pouring forth the water of eternal life!* You sent him forth, giving him freely the all-holy Spirit,* consubstantial with You, the Almighty Father,* and Your Son, who shone forth from Your Essence,* by which he prophesied the saving coming of Christ our God,* proclaiming salvation to all the nations!"
