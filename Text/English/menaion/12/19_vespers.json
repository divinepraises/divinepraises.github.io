    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "You desired the goodly name given to martyrs, O much suffering passion-bearer,* and endured pangs with bold resolve, O most blessed one,* expecting to be translated to the rest which is devoid of pain,* and seeking to receive heavenly honours,* a dwelling-place in paradise,* never-waning light and everlasting life.",
    "You endured the most savage of pangs:* the tearing away of your finger-nails, cruel piercing,* molten lead and the severing of your head,* and joined the choir of athletes, rejoicing, O much suffering one.* We celebrate your annual memorial, O athlete Boniface,* converser with the angels.",
    "Sending you, her manservant, before her, O Boniface,* Aglais acquired a divine master who tamed the passions,* attained mastery over tyrants, cast down the enemy,* and was arrayed in a crown of victory.* Having constructed for you a holy temple all-adorned,* she enshrined you therein, praising you in sanctity."

  "theotokion": "I lie upon the bed of despondency, O most immaculate one,* and pass my life in slothfulness,* and I fear the time of my end, O Theotokos.* Let not the most evil serpent rend my lowly soul asunder without pity, like a lion.* Going before me in your goodness,* before my end raise me up to repentance.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "Beholding Christ, who loves mankind, crucified, O all-pure one,* His side pierced by a spear, you cried aloud, weeping:* What is this, O my Son?* How have the ungrateful people rewarded You for the good You did do them?* And do You hasten to leave me childless, O most Beloved?* I marvel, O Compassionate One, at Your voluntary crucifixion!"
