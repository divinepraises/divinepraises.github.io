    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "The wondrous Thyrsus, the divinely wise Callinicus, and the glorious Leucius,* confessing the uncreated Trinity, with most courageous resolve* endured torments most grievous and intense,* and as victors have received crowns of victory,* becoming fellow citizens with the immaterial hosts.",
    "The great Philemon, Adrian most rich, and the wise Apollonius* quenched the flame of polytheism with torrents of blood,* watered all the earth with divine streams of the knowledge of God,* and dried up rivers of the passions with showers of healing and grace divine,* in that they are our fervent defenders.",
    "The glorious martyrs, the most beauteous flowers* blossomed forth in the meadow,* emitting the divine fragrance of the Spirit,* and perfuming the thoughts of those who with faith honour their annual memorial,* their sufferings and struggles, and their godly end.* Rejoicing, they dwell in never-waning light."

  "theotokion": "I lie upon the bed of despondency, O most immaculate one,* and pass my life in slothfulness,* and I fear the time of my end, O Theotokos.* Let not the most evil serpent mercilessly rend my lowly soul asunder like a lion.* Going before me in your goodness before my end,* raise me up to repentance.",
  "stavrotheotokion" : "Beholding Christ crucified, who loves mankind, O all-pure one, His side pierced by a spear,* you cried aloud, weeping:* What is this, O my Son?* How have the ungrateful people rewarded You for the good You did for them?* And do You hasten to leave me childless, O most Beloved?* I marvel, O Compassionate One, at Your voluntary crucifixion!"
