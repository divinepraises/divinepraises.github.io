    "1, Podoben “All-gloriuos martyrs…”",
    "O father Patapius,* having quenched the burning of the assaults of the flesh with abstinence,* like Elijah of old you made your abode in the desert,* purifying your mind with unceasing prayers to God.* And pray now that He grant our souls* peace and great mercy.",
    "O father Patapius,* you enrolled yourself in the choirs of fasters,* adorning yourself with dispassion;* and you made your abode in the mansions of the venerable,* where the light is unwaning and the Tree of Life stands.* And pray now that peace and great mercy* be granted our souls.",
    "O father Patapius,* you shone forth as a beacon from Egypt,* enlightening the world with the splendours of your miracles,* and dispelling the gloom of soul-destroying infirmities,* and driving off the darkness of the demons.* And pray now that peace and great mercy* be granted our souls."
