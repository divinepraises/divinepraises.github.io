  "kontakia": ["<i>(Tone 3)</i>  Today this martyr smashes the demon by her steadfast faith* and grinds to bits the enemy of holiness by martyrdom.* The angels bring her crowns and gifts.* O God on high and Saviour of the world, save us for her sake.", "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Your soul shone with light from the One born for us of the Virgin,* and you sparkled with all the virtues,* for you are worthy of all praise.* You shared your worldly wealth with those on earth* and stored for yourself treasures in heaven,* becoming a marvelous example of ascetical life.* Therefore, O holy Melanie, we honour you with love."]
