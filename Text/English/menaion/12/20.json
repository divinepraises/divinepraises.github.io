    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> You sat on the chair of the apostles and exercised their powers.* You are the inspiration of prelates and the glory of martyrs.* You faced savage beasts, fire, and sword all for the sake of the faith.* You made the course of truth straight, even at the price of your own blood.* O priest-martyr Ignatius, beg Christ our God to save our souls.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Bethlehem, make ready, for Eden has been opened for all.* Ephrathah, be alert, for the Tree of life has blossomed forth from the Virgin in the cave.* Her womb has become a spiritual paradise* wherein the divine Fruit was planted,* and if we eat of it we shall live and not die like Adam.* Christ is coming forth to bring back to life* the likeness that had been lost in the beginning."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> The moving celebration of your successful fight* is like an announcement of the One who is to be born of the Virgin.* Because of your eagerness to possess Him forever,* you hastened to be devoured by ferocious beasts.* Therefore, O glorious Ignatius, you were called the God-bearer.",
    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Today, the Virgin is on her way to the cave* where she will give birth in a manner beyond understanding* to the Word who is in all eternity.* Rejoice, therefore, O universe, when you hear it heralded.* With the angels and the shepherds, glorify Him who chose to be seen as a new-born babe* while remaining God in all eternity."
