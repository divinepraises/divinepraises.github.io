    "1, Podoben “All-gloriuos martyrs…”",
    "With the dye of your precious blood* you made make for yourself a costly robe of purple,* and, having arrayed yourself therein,* you truly dwell in the kingdom on high, standing before God, the King of all.* Entreat Him that He grant to our souls peace and great mercy.",
    "With Sebastian there suffered Zoe, Mark and Marcellinus,* and the divinely wise Tiburtius,* enduring threefold waves of torments;* and they have now made their abode in divine peace devoid of pain,* wherein they pray that peace and great mercy be granted to our souls.",
    "O blessed invincible martyrs,* having forsaken earthly things,* you have hastened to the heavens,* adorned with your wounds and splendidly arrayed in your honoured sufferings.* Pray that peace and great mercy be granted to our souls."

  "theotokion": "In your womb you bore Christ, the Fire of divinity, O all-pure one.* Beseech Him now that He quench the easily kindled matter of my passions,* deliver me from everlasting fire,* and vouchsafe me the splendour of the righteous* when He comes to judge all things.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "Once, the undefiled Virgin,* beholding on the Tree Him to whom she had given birth from her seedless womb,* unable to bear the wounding of her womb, said, rending her hair:* How is it that You who hold all creation in the palm of Your hand* are lifted, up on the Cross like one condemned,* O You who desire to save mankind in whatever way is possible?"
