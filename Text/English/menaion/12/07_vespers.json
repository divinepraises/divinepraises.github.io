    "1, Podoben “The joy of the heavenly ranks…”",
    "Adorning the seat of government with your virtues,* you likewise received the hierarchal office through divine inspiration.* Having been a faithful steward of grace in both, O Ambrose,* you inherited a twofold crown.",
    "In abstinence and sorrow, in many vigils and in lengthy prayers,* you cleansed soul and body, O divinely wise one;* henceforth manifest as a chosen vessel of Christ God, equal to the apostles,* you received heavenly gifts.",
    "As Nathan reproved David,* so you boldly reproved the pious emperor who once had sinned, O most blessed Ambrose,* and you openly cut him off from the Church;* and having chastised him in godly manner with a penance,* you numbered him again among your flock."
