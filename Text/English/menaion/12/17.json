    "<i>(Tone 3)</i> Enlightened by the Spirit, you pure heart became the receptacle of most splendid prophecy: for you beheld far-off things as though they were present, and, cast into the pit, tamed the lions. Wherefore, we honour you, O blessed and glorious Prophet Daniel.",
    "<i>(Tone 6)</i> Armed by the Being that defies description,* you defied the man-made idol, O thrice blessed youth.* In the midst of the unbearable flames you stood and cried out to God:* “In Your mercy, O gracious One, hasten and come to our aid,”* for You can do whatever You will."
