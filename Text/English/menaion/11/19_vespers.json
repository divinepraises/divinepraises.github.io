    "1, Podoben “All-gloriuos martyrs…”",
    "As a splendid receptacle of the Spirit and one illumined by Him,* O Obadiah of vision most divine,* you were enriched by the image of prophecy,* the foreknowledge of things to come, and the knowledge of the truth.* Pray now that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.",
    "Of the primary traits and essential proofs by which God is depicted* the glorious and honourable prophets partake as a gift secondarily* through communion and grace when the Lord illumines His favoured ones* with His effulgence. ",
    "Full of never-waning light,* beholding glory which transcends understanding and reason,* and standing before the Master of all,* you were a glorious prophet and a divine herald of God.* Entreat Him that He grant our souls peace and great mercy.",
    "4, Podoben “As one valiant among the martyrs…”",
    "You were firmer than a pillar, stronger than brass, and mightier than iron;* for, when heated by fire, each of them disintegrates and is straightway destroyed, overcome by force thereof;* but your unwavering right hand, outstretched over the burning coals, O most wise one,* triumphed most gloriously.",
    "As though you were a priest standing before God and coming before Him,* not with another's blood, but with your own most of all, O blessed one,* you offered an incense of sweet savour with your martyr’s hand,* not to demonic illusions, but to Christ, the Saviour and Master,* who reigns forever.",
    "A priest who offers and a lamb which is offered:* we joyously call you both, O most lauded one;* for as both were you immolated in the fire of torment* as an unblemished sacrifice to God.* Entreat Him that He save them that ever honour your most glorious memory."

  "theotokion": "With the showers of the all-holy Spirit* bedew my thought, O all-pure one,* who gave birth to Christ, the gentle Rain from heaven,* who, by His compassions, washes away the incalculably boundless iniquities of men;* dry up the wellspring of my passions, and ever vouchsafe to me a torrent* of the sweetness of life by your supplications.",
  "stavrotheotokion": "As she beheld You, the Lamb and Shepherd, upon the Tree,* the ewe-lamb who gave birth to You lamented and maternally exclaimed to You:* O my Son most desired,* how is it that You are suspended upon the Tree of the Cross, O Longsuffering One?* How is it, O Word, that Your hands and feet have been nailed by the iniquitous?* How have You shed Yourblood, O Master?"
