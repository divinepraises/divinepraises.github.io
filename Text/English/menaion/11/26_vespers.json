    "O most blessed Alypius, from your childhood you offered your life to Christ our God,* and, strengthened by Him, you submitted the passions of your flesh to your mind,* subjecting what is worse to that which is higher.* Pray that the Lord grant our souls* peace and great mercy.",
    "O divinely wise Alypius,* you were shown to be a magnificent beacon,* illumining the earth with the splendours of your wonders and your godly deeds.* After your repose the unwaning Light received you.* Pray that Christ grant to our souls* peace and great mercy.",
    "You were an immovable pillar for monks, O wise one,* standing higher than your pillar,* vexed by the heat of the day and cold and by many fasts.* You received the divine gifts of the Spirit to heal infirmities* and to drive out the most cruel passions.* Pray that Christ grant to our souls* peace and great mercy."

  "stavrotheotokion": "The unblemished ewe-lamb and Mistress,* as she beheld her Lamb on the Cross, bereft of form and beauty,* lamenting, said: Woe is me!* Where has beauty set, O You who are most sweet?* Where is Your splendour?* Where the shining grace of Your image,* O my Son most beloved?"
