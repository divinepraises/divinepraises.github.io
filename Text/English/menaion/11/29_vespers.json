    "4, Podoben “Called from on high…”",
    "Manifestly illumined by the brightness of the Spirit of God,* most blessed Paramon,* you despised the total darkness of idolatry.* When your time had come, most blessed one,* you approached the suffering before you with a courageous mind!* Revealed as victorious, you cast down the prideful enemy of all mortals,* as you magnified Christ!* Entreat Him to save and enlighten our souls!",
    "Witnessing a great multitude slaughtered for the King and God of all, * you burned with divine zeal, Paramon, crying out:* I am ever a true servant of Christ!* Understand, evil tyrants,* for behold, I was summoned and now I come* to be slain like an innocent lamb!* Therefore, do not be deceived:* I am forced to become an acceptable sacrifice to Him* Who for my sake was freely slain in the flesh!",
    "The honoured choir of athletes,* three hundred seventy in number,* with faith cast down the falsehood of the evil-doers' idolatry.* You also were crowned with them,* having struggled with a courageous mind, Paramon,* and rejoicing, you joined the choirs of the bodiless hosts!* Ever pray with them that we who honour and bless you* may be delivered from all sorrow and dangers!"
