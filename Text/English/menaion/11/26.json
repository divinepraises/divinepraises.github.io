    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> You seem a terror unscalable to the devils,* crippling them by the club of your effective prayers.* You chase away passion by fasting.* You are a firm support of those wavering.* O blessed father Alypius,* beg Christ our God to save our souls.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Sated with miracles, the whole world blesses you today.* Drunk with your blood, the earth keeps a holiday.* The Christians of Kiev rejoice at the dedication of your Church, O martyr George,* O chosen vessel of the Holy Spirit who pleased Christ.* Beg Him to forgive the sins* of those who come to your Church with faith and prayer.* Beg Him to give peace to the world and mercy to our souls."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 8)</i> The Church glorifies and honours you today O Alypius,* a perfect example of virtue and pride of the ascetics.* Through your prayers, release from their sins* all those who eagerly venerate your life and struggles.",
    "<i>(Tone 2)</i> Let us who walk in procession into this consecrated Church* praise the heavenly and triumphant martyr George.* He gained the laurels of victory over the enemy,* and God deigned to set him among the saints in his name."
