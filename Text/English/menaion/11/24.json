    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> By your virtues as by rays of the sun you enlightened the unbelieving philosophers,* and like the most bright moon you drove away the darkness of disbelief from those walking in the night;* you convinced the queen, and also chastised the tyrant, God-summoned bride, blessed Catherine.* You hastened with desire to the heavenly bridal chamber of the fairest Bridegroom of Christ,* and you were crowned by Him with a royal crown;* Standing before Him with the Angels, pray for us who keep your most sacred memory!",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Having passed through martyrdom like a true soldier,* you have marched on to the King immortal, O Mercurius.* You have been welcomed into the choir of martyrs.* Receive our prayers and pray in turn for us,* for we hold fast to your precious memory."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 2)</i> O lovers of martyrs,* raise up an honored chorus in godly manner,* honoring the most wise Catherine;* for in the arena she preached Christ* and trod upon the serpent,* putting down the knowledge of the rhetors.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Let us bless and glorify in hymns Mercurius,* the invincible warrior in battles,* the unfailing patron in troubles,* for he delivers from tribulations and sorrows** them that joyfully celebrate his feast."
