    "1, Podoben “All-gloriuos martyrs…”",
    "Holy preachers, who travelled the whole world in splendour* like winged eagles,* you led those pursued by the devil* to the incorruptible Faith!* Pray that our souls may be given peace and great mercy!",
    "Let us honour Tertius and Sosipater with holy voices,* with Olympus and Rodion* and together with them Erastus, the initiate of the mysteries,* and the godly Quartus:* They glorify Christ our God,* beseeching Him to grant our souls peace and great mercy!",
    "Blessed ones, you have led to Christ God the gentiles,* delivered by the blood of Him Who was well pleased to be born on earth* and Who willingly endured the Cross and death!* Most wise ones, now entreat Him* that He may grant our souls peace and great mercy!"
