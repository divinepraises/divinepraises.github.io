    "8, Podoben “O Most glorious wonder!…”",
    "Most glorious wonder!* The handsome Acepsimus who ministered to the martyrs* today is crowned with a wreath of hymns.* He puts before us the suffering he endured for his worship of God* and wounds the bodiless enemy!* What great gifts of grace he received!* Through his prayers, save our souls, O Christ,* since You are great in love and mercy!",
    "Most glorious wonder!* Joseph shines forth as a star from Persia!* He destroyed the outrage of sorcery through the Spirit;* he extinguished the impious worship of fire with the streams of his blood!* How great is the strength by which he cast down the demons!* Through his prayers, save our souls, O Christ,* since You are compassionate!",
    "Most glorious wonder!* The steadfast Aithalas, a champion of suffering,* is revealed as an ever-blossoming garden.* Cut down, it brings forth the flower of wounds;* slain, it then begins to live! What great strength of nature through which he endured!* Through his prayers, save our souls, O Christ,* since You are compassionate!",

    "The three children preserved unharmed by the Persian fire* mystically foreshadowed your thrice-radiant unity of mind* and your martyrdom in Christ!* Athletes of the ineffable Trinity and supernatural Unity,* as they stood in the midst of the flames and did not cry out against God,* so also you did not refuse to die * when your lives were not spared by the love of Christ.* As in their midst, a fourth appeared who sprinkled them with dew,* so also Christ, one of the Trinity,* received you into a place of refreshment!* Acepsimus, Joseph and Aithalas, chosen by God,* ever pray for our souls!"
