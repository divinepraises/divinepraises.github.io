  "kontakia": ["<i>(Tone 3)</i> As a flower longs for the sun, so you loved the sun of truth, Christ God,* as a zealous Shepherd, you taught the wisdom of virtue through-out the Carpathian lands* revealing the deepest humility of life:* like a rock of faith, you blocked the way of the godless,* as a precious pearl, you accepted suffering even to the shedding of your blood,* and so today with heartfelt reverence we call upon you, O priest-martyr Theodore,* that you intercede for our sinful souls before the Throne of the All-Merciful One."]
