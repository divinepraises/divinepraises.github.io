    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Your martyr Gordius, O Lord,* by his passion acquired the crown of incorruptibility from You, our God.* For possessing Your power, he overcame the torturers* and shattered the feeble insolence of demons.* By his supplications, save our souls!",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Make ready, O Zabulon,* and prepare yourself, O Nephtali;* O River Jordan, stop and receive with joy* the Master coming to be baptized.* O Adam, rejoice with the first mother, Eve,* and do not hide yourselves as before in Paradise.* For, having seen you unclothed,* Christ has appeared to clothe you with the first robe;* He has appeared to renew all creation."

  "kontakia": [
    "<i>(Tone 2)</i> As a bright and unerring star you appeared to the world* proclaiming with your rays the Sun, that is, Christ, O martyr Gordius,* and you have extinguished all error.* But to us you give light, praying without ceasing for all of us.",
    "<i>(Tone 4)</i> Today the Lord stood in Jordan’s current telling John:* Do not be afraid to baptize Me,* for I have come to save Adam, the first man."
