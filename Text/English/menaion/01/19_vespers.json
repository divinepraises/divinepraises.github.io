    "Reaching out, inspired one,* for blessedness surpassing thought,* you took abstinence for luxury;* poverty for wealth,* lack of possessions as true abundance* and humility for glory!* As you intended, you reached your heart's desire, Macarius:** Now you dwell in the mansions of the saints!",
    "You completed the course of ascetic life without wavering,* and you kept the faith, Father!* Thus you gained a crown of righteousness prepared for you by Christ,* Who grants the prizes of victory,* bestowing the gifts and rewards of labours.** Pray now, God-bearing one, that we also may run this course!",
    "You denied yourself every pleasure,* divinely-wise one:* You pummelled your body and embittered your senses* through labours of hardship and abstinence,* through long-suffering in temptations and patience in adversities.* In their place you have received unending joy,**everlasting delight and ineffable glory!",

    "Rejoice, Egypt! You blossomed forth a great protector:* Macarius, the blessed!* He shone with the wisdom of the Holy Spirit,* transcending all asceticism with his virtuous way of life.* We offer him as mediator, beseeching him** that he may intercede with Christ that our souls may be saved!"
