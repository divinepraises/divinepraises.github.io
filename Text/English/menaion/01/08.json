    "<i>(Tone 8)</i> In you, O venerable mother Dominica, the faithful image of God shone forth,* for you carried you cross and followed Christ.* You taught by your deeds how to spurn the body, for it passes away;* and how to value the soul, for it is immortal.* Therefore, your soul is forever in happiness with the angels."
