    "1, Podoben “The joy of the heavenly ranks…”",
    "First, you transformed your love:* You made yourself faithful by the higher action of your mind.* You departed from the crookedness of pleasure's vanity* and becoming a stranger, blessed one,* you rightly walked by the hard ascent of virtue.",
    "You hastened to the godly haven,* calmly passing through the waves of the storm of life.* You steered the ship of your soul without foundering* through the bitterness of pleasures, most honoured one,* loaded with spiritual cargo!",
    "You became a stranger in godly emulation* of Him Who for our sake came from on high to raise up the fallen. * Unknown, you lived among your relatives, wise one!* You ever pray to God, Xenia, on behalf of the faithful."
