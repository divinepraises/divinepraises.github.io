    "2, Podoben “When from the Tree…”",
    "The glory of your soul shone brilliantly,* for you illumined yourself with faith and almsgiving.* You rejoiced to distribute your wealth to the poor!* Your righteousness abides for ever in the unfading light* which shone out from you, Father.* There you behold your children and her that gave them birth,* dwelling in the heavenly city.",
    "You turned away from corruptible glory* and were counted worthy of the glory that is incorruptible and divine.* Having trampled down all the pleasures of life, God-bearers,* you indeed desired greatly the all-beautiful Christ.* He saved you from the triple waves and tempest of the world* and guided you to the calm and radiant life, most wealthy ones!",
    "You killed the passions of the flesh * and clothed yourselves in the garments of dispassion* woven from the purity of your life.* While yet in the body you manifested a life equal to the angels!* You were great in wisdom* and have been counted worthy of the glory of the angels on high,* where you delight in the radiance of God!"
