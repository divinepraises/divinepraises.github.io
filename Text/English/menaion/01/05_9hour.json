    "It was astonishing to see at the river Jordan the Creator of heaven and earth,* Who stripped Himself naked, and, as a servant,* received from a servant baptism for our salvation;* the hosts of angels, filled with fear and joy, were struck with amazement.* With them we also worship You, crying out: Save us!",

    "The hand with which you, O Forefunner and baptizer,* touched the most pure head of our Lord and pointed Him out to the people,* stretch out to Him in our behalf, seeing as you have great confidence in Him,* for He said that you are the greatest of all the prophets.* Also raise your eyes to the all-holy Spirit,* Whom they have seen in the form of a dove descending upon Him,* and implore for us, O Baptizer, His grace.* Come and join us; give us the sign to sing and begin a hymn of praise.<br>"

    "A reading from the Prophecy of Isaiah.",
    "Thus says the Lord: In a time of favour I answer you, on the day of salvation I help you, To restore the land and allot the desolate heritages, saying to the prisoners: Come out! To those in darkness: show yourselves! Along the ways they shall find pasture, on every bare height shall their pastures be. They shall not hunger or thirst, nor shall the scorching wind or the sun strike them; For he who pities them leads them and guides them beside springs of water. I will cut a road through all my mountains, and make my highways level. See, some shall come from afar, others from the north and the west, and some from the land of Syene. Sing out O heavens, and rejoice, O earth, break forth into song, you mountains, For the Lord comforts his people and shows mercy to his afflicted. But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me.” Can a mother for get her infant, be without tenderness for the child of her womb? Even should she forget, I will never forget you.",
    "A reading from the Epistle of St. Paul to Titus.",
    "Titus my child: the grace of God has appeared, saving all and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, as we await the blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of the great God and of our saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people as his own, eager to do what is good. But when the kindness and generous love of God our saviour appeared, not because of any righteous deeds we had done but because of his mercy, he saved us through the bath of rebirth and renewal by the holy Spirit, whom he richly poured out on us through Jesus Christ our saviour, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope eternal life.",
    "A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.",
    "In those times, Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw God’s Spirit descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from the heavens said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”"
