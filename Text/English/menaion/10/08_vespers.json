    "8, Podoben “O all-glorious wonder…”",
    "O all-glorious wonder!* Showing courage, a woman has trampled the enemy underfoot* and quenched the passions of the body through great abstinence.* Zealously taking the Cross of the Lord upon her shoulders,* Pelagia put off the burden of life’s possessions and followed after Christ* through the teachings of the wise Nonus.",
    "You have been revealed to us as a new Thecla!* For, finding your teacher Nonus to be another Paul,* you accepted his teachings, O glorious one,* having fervently embraced repentance,* and through abstinence you joined yourself to Christ,* O all-blessed and most honoured Pelagia.* Therefore, never cease to pray to Christ that we be saved.",
    "Rejoice, O most honoured Pelagia!* For, most honourably enkindled by zeal divine,* you cast aside the pleasure of fornication, O all-blessed one,* and hastening to Nonus, cried aloud:* You must give answer for my deeds* if you will not seal me with the sign of Christ, O glorious one,* investing me through baptism with pure raiment!",

    "Where sin has increased, there grace abounds, as the Apostle teaches;* for in prayers and tears you dried up the abyss of many offenses, O Pelagia,* and finally brought to the Lord right acceptable repentance,* and therein pray for our souls.",
    "n",
    "When she beheld You, the Lamb and Shepherd, upon the Tree,* the ewe-lamb who gave You birth lamented and exclaimed to You maternally:* O my beloved Son, how is it that You have been suspended upon the tree of the Cross, O Longsuffering One?* How have Your hands and feet been nailed by the iniquitous, O Word?* How have You shed Your blood, O Master?"
