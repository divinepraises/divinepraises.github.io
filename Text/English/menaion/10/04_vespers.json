    "4, Podoben “You have given a sign...”",
    "Receiving the grace of the most holy Spirit,* O most glorious Hierotheus,* you have now passed through all the earth,* teaching men to worship the Unity in three Hypostases:* the unoriginate Father,* the Source of the Godhead,* and with Him the Son Who is equally enthroned* and consubstantial with the Father,* Who was born of the Virgin* and became a man bearing flesh.",
    "As one pleasing to God* you offered up your soul as a sacred and divine gift,* and committed your sacred body as a thing divine,* which hallowed the souls of those who believe in God Almighty,* and poured forth salvation upon the faithful.* Therefore, we bless your memory and burial,* we love your miracles and proclaim your words.",
    "You beheld the twelve apostles* at the dormition of the all-glorious Ever-virgin,* the all-pure Theotokos, the Mother of the Lord,* and with you was Dionysius, who described the hierarchies.* With them we, the faithful,* bless your most festive and all-holy solemnity, O glorious Hierotheus.",

    "2",
    "When you were present at the divine dormition of the Mother of God,* O blessed herald of God,* you gladdened the hearts of the faithful with divine proclamations,* delighting the sacred company of the apostles, the preachers of God,* and hymning the mysteries of God with divine ecstasy.* Therefore, having received boldness before Christ, O hierarch Hierotheus,* pray in behalf of our souls."
