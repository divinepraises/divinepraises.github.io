    "6, Podoben “Having set all aside…”",
    "Having disdained all earthly might and come to hate the flesh,* you came to love our holy God;* and wearing a vesture of dishonor put upon you in mockery,* you have received garments of light from heaven* and robes which cannot be rent asunder.* Dancing therein, O crowned ones who are most rich,* be a veil of protection and raiment for all of us* who have been stripped bare of life* through the deception of the serpent.",
    "O all-glorious Sergius and all-praised Bacchus,* vessels of the Spirit, torrents pouring forth healings upon all,* our protectors and mighty champions of the Church,* voluntary sacrifices and honored victims,* beacons illumining the ends of the earth with the light of piety:* dispel the darkness which lies upon our souls* and drive away all the gloom of evil.",
    "O glorious athletes, having issued forth from your corruptible bodies,* you received habitations which pass not away,* noetic gladness, never-waning light, and incorruptible life without care.* Yet pray that we also may receive these things who have been slain by the passions* and have turned aside to sin,* O Sergius and Bacchus, intercessors and havens for the faithful,* who pray with boldness in behalf of our souls.",
    "g",
    "4",
    "Radiant and twofold is the effulgence of the martyrs Sergius and Bacchus,* for they cast down the savagery of the tormenters,* abolished the falsehood of idolatry* and, preaching with radiant voices, proclaimed the perfect mystery of divine knowledge.* Through their supplications, O Christ, O Giver of the law,* Judge of the contest and Bestower of crowns,* vouchsafe that we also may receive crowns of might* against the invisible powers of evil."
