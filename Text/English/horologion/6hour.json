  "chapter": "Let your mercies, O Lord, come quickly to our aid, for we are utterly poor;* help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of Your name.* O Lord, deliver us, and have mercy on our sins,* for Your name’s sake.",
  "prayer": "O God and Lord of powers, Maker of all creation, in the compassion of Your incomprehensible mercy You sent Your only-begotten Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race. Through His precious Cross He tore up the record of our sins, and triumphed over the principalities and powers of darkness. O loving Master, accept our supplications of thanksgiving and entreaty; and deliver us from destructive and dark transgression, and from all our foes, visible and invisible, who seek to harm us. Nail down our flesh through fear of You, and prevent our hearts from inclining towards words or thoughts of evil, but rather wound our souls with longing for You; that always gazing upon You and guided by the light that comes from You, seeing You the unapproachable and everlasting Light, we may unceasingly confess and thank You, the Father without beginning, with Your only-begotten Son and Your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.",

    "We bow before Your sacred image, O gracious Lord,* and beg forgiveness for our offenses, O Christ our God;* for You, of Your own free will, deigned to ascend the Cross in Your human nature* to deliver from the bondage of the Enemy those whom You have created.* Therefore, we gratefully cry out to You:* through Your coming to save the world, O Savior, You have filled all with joy.",
    "O Mother of God, fount of mercy; * deem us worthy of compassion. * Look upon a sinful people; * as always show your power. * For placing our trust in you, we cry out to you: “Hail!” * as once did Gabriel, the prince of angels.",
    "We praise you, O Mother of God, more glorious than all others; * Death was put to death, and Hades was crushed by the Cross of your Son; * He raised us from death and granted us eternal life. * Paradise is again opened for us to enjoy as before. * Therefore, in thanksgiving we glorify the love and power of Christ our God.
