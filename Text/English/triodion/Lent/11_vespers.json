    "Grant me compunction, and distancing from evil* and perfect repentance:* to me who is drowning in carnal passion* and is far from you, O God the King of all,* to me who have no other hope.* And save me the prodigal, O Jesus all-mighty, the Saviour of our souls.",
    "The admirable Moses, cleansed by fasting* saw the One for Whom he longed.* Imitating him, O my humble soul,* strive to cleanse yourself of evil on the day of abstinence,* so that you can see the Lord* Who grants you forgiveness, cleansing and salvation,* and Who is good and loves mankind.",
    "6",
    "Let us now start with joy the second week of fasting,* completing day by day, O brothers*. Let us make ourselves a fiery chariot, like Elijah the Tishbite,* from the four great virtues.* Let us raise our mind through absence of passions* let us arm our flesh with purity,* and thus we shall prevail over the enemy."
