  "day name": "Second Sunday of Lent",
  "kontakia": "<i>(Tone 4)</i> The time for action is now revealed;* the Judge is at the door.* Let us rise and keep the fast,* offering tears of contrition with alms and crying aloud:* our sins are more numerous than the sands of the sea,* but forgive us, O Maker of all, that we may receive incorruptible crowns."
