    "Countless times have I sinned against You, and countless torments await me:* the gnashing of teeth and weeping that finds no comfort,* the fire of Gehenna, the darkness of Tartar.* O most righteous judge, grant me tears,* that I may receive forgiveness for the many wicked things I have done,* as I fast and cry to You:* O Master Christ have compassion upon me,* in Your great and abundant mercy.",
    "I have gone astray upon the mountains of grievous sin:* seek me, O Word, and call me back to You,* and drive out from my mind all the ways of wickedness.* Restore me from death to life and cleanse me by fasting,* as I weep unceasingly and cry to You:* O Master Christ have compassion upon me, in Your great and abundant mercy.",
    "As we start upon the third week of the Fast, O faithful, let us glorify the Holy Trinity,* and joyfully pass through the time that remains.* Withering the passions of the flesh from our souls,* let us gather divine flowers, weaving garlands for the queen of days,* that with crowns upon our heads* we may sing in praise of Christ the Conqueror."

    "Having cast from my disordered mind the Father’s bridle,* I have lived with bestial thoughts of sin,* and wretched as I am, I have wasted all of my life in prodigality.* Forsaking the food that gives strength to man’s heart,* I have fed upon the fleeting pleasures of life.* But, O good Father, shut me not out from Your compassionate love for mankind,* but open it to me as You once did to the Prodigal Son, and save me.",
