    "I was entrusted with a sinless and living land,* but I sowed the ground with sin and reaped with a sickle the ears of slothfulness;* in thick sheaves I garnered my actions,* but winnowed them not on the threshing floor of repentance.* But I beg You, my God, the pre-eternal husbandman,* with the wind of Your loving-kindness winnow the chaff of my works,* and grant to my soul the corn of forgiveness;* shut me in Your heavenly storehouse* and save me.",
    "Brethren, let us learn the meaning of this mystery.* For when the Prodigal Son ran back from sin to his Father’s house,* his loving Father came out to meet him and kissed him.* He restored to the Prodigal the tokens of his proper glory,* and mystically he made glad on high, sacrificing the fatted calf.* Let our lives, then, be worthy of the loving Father who has offered sacrifice,* and of the glorious Victim* who is the Saviour of our souls.",

    "Of what great blessings in my wretchedness have I deprived myself!* From what a kingdom in my misery have I fallen!* I have wasted the riches that were given to me,* I have transgressed the commandment.* Alas, unhappy soul!* You are henceforth condemned to the eternal fire.* Therefore before the end cry out to Christ our God:* Receive me as the Prodigal Son, O God,* and have mercy upon me."

    "I have wasted the wealth which the Father gave to me,* and in my wretchedness I have fed with dumb beasts.* Yearning after their food, I remained hungry and could not eat my fill.* But now I return to the compassionate Father* and cry out with tears:* I fall down before Your loving-kindness,* receive me as a hired servant, and save me."
