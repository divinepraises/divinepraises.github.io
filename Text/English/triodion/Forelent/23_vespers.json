    "With great joy let us accept, O faithful, the godly inspired tidings of the Fast,* as did the Ninevites of old,* and also the harlots and the publicans* who hearkened to the preaching of repentance by John.* Through abstinence let us prepare ourselves to attend the Master’s divine mystery in Sion.* With tears let us wholly cleanse ourselves before the sacred washing of the feet;* and let us pray that we may behold the fulfilment and revelation of the true Passover.* Let us make ready to worship the Cross and resurrection of Christ God,* that we may cry aloud to Him:* Deprive us not of our expectation, O Lover of mankind.",
    "Wise was the trade that you made, O saints!* Giving your blood, and inheriting heaven as your reward;* having suffered tribulation for a time, you now rejoice eternally.* Truly wisely have you traded:* forsaking things corruptible, you have received things incorruptible;* and rejoicing with the choirs of angels you now continually hymn the praises* of the consubstantial Trinity.",

    "Once, when the unblemished Virgin beheld on the Tree* Him to whom she had given birth from her seedless womb,* unable to endure the wounding of her womb, she said, rending her hair:* “O You who sustain all creation,* how have You been uplifted upon the Cross as one condemned,* desiring to save mankind in every way?”"
