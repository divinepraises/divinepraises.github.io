    "2",
    "For those who steadfastly venerate the Cross of Christ,* it is a bridle restraining all manner of sensuality, and a law of abstinence.* For, ever looking upon Him who was crucified thereon,* they crucify the flesh with its passions and lusts.* Let us also flee from such things;* fasting in purity, that we become one with Him,* who out of love for mankind* has made Himself one with us by suffering the Passion,* enabling us to share in His own passionlessness;* for He has great mercy.",
    "Having no desire for earthly pleasure, O passion-bearers,* you were granted heavenly blessings,* and became fellow-citizens with the angels.* By their prayers, O Lord, have mercy on us and save us.",
    "2, Podoben “When from the Tree…”",
    "gn",
    "When you beheld, O pure Virgin, the unblemished Vine,* whom you conceived within your womb, hanging upon the Tree,* lamenting, you cried aloud:* O Child, O sweetness which drives away the drunkenness of the passions,* O Benefactor, grant this for the sake of me who has given birth to You, by Your divine comforting,* since You are Compassionate."
