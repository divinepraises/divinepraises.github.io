    "Having endured the first nakedness through greed,* we were overcome by the bitter taste thereof,* and became exiles from God.* But let us return to repentance* and by fasting, purify our senses, which war against us.* And having thereby strengthened our hearts with the hope of grace,* and not with foods which are of no benefit,* let us partake of the Lamb of God,* who, on the holy and radiant night of His Resurrection,* having offered Himself for our sake,* and communed with the disciples, at the mystical supper,* dispersed the darkness of ignorance* by the Light of His Resurrection.",
    "O martyrs of the Lord,* you sanctify every place and heal every manner of infirmities:* and now we entreat you to intercede on our behalf* that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the enemy.",
    "gn",
    "Those in heaven hymn you,* O joyously blessed Mother unwedded,* and we glorify your inscrutable birthgiving, O Theotokos;* pray that our souls be saved!"
