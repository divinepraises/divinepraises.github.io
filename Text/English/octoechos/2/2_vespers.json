    "О Christ, who alone are without sin,* who alone are without guile, who alone are the Wellspring of goodness:* Behold my oppression, behold my tribulation.* Wash all the wounds of my stripes, and in Your mercy save Your servant,* that, having driven the clouds of slothfulness far from me,* I may glorify You, my supremely good Saviour.",
    "Look, О my lowly soul!* Behold your works, which are all-defiled!* Behold your nakedness and, alas, your isolation!* For you shall be separated from God and the angels,* and cast into endless torment.* Come to your senses, arise, make haste and cry aloud:* I have sinned, О Saviour!* Grant me forgiveness, and save me!",
    "I have grievously defiled my body* and brought corruption upon my soul and heart by my vile thoughts;* I have wounded all my senses, have blinded my eyes,* have stopped up mine ears with filth, and have defiled my tongue;* and all that I have is shameful.* Wherefore, falling down before You, I cry aloud:* О Master Christ, I have sinned against You!* I have sinned; forgive and save me!"

    "With the cry of the publican I cry out to You, О Christ my Saviour:* Cleanse me as You did him,* and have mercy on me, О God!",
