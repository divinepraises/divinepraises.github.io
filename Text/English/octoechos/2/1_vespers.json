    "As You are God, You are by nature wholly compassionate, merciful, and good;* wherefore, we beseech You, О Christ our Saviour,* and falling down before You, we cry, ever calling out to You:* Grant to Your servants remission of their many transgressions* and forgiveness of every thing wherein they have committed offenses,* in that You are the compassionate God and the Lover of mankind.",
    "Desiring to save all for whose sake You had become a man, О Saviour,* as God You manifested Yourself as a man.* Save us who bow down before Your commandments,* for You did not come to save the righteous,* but through the grace of divine baptism* to loose us who are bound by many sins in the chains of our transgressions, О Lover of mankind,* in that You are compassionate and the Lover of mankind."
