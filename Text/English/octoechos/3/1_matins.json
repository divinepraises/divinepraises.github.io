    "3",
    "Bring together my scattered mind, O Lord,* and purify my hardened heart;* grant me repentance of Peter,* the sigh of the publican,* the tears of the adulteress,* so that I may cry out to You with a loud voice:* O God, save me, for You alone are kind-hearted and love mankind.",
    "When I am praying,* I frequently see myself committing sin,* for while I am singing hymns with my lips, my soul is thinking foolish things.* Correct both through repentance,* O Christ, and save me.",
    "Come, people, let us honour the memory of the holy martyrs;* for having been a spectacle for angels and men,* they received crowns of victory from Christ,* and pray in behalf of our souls.",
    "gn",
    "O most pure Lady, you are the boast of the angels,* the praise of the apostles, and the fulfillment of the prophets;* accept our supplications."
