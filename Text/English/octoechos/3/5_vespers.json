    "3, Podoben “They set up…”",
    "О Lord, who in Your divine nature are beyond suffering,* You endured suffering in Your human nature,* being nailed to the Cross and pierced in the side by a spear,* from whence You have poured forth upon me two rivers of ineffable mysteries.",
    "With mockery You were wounded by the crown plaited of thorns, О King and Saviour of all,* who have torn apart the proscription of thorny sin;* and taking the reed in Your hands, in the book of heaven, You have recorded all of us who believe in You.",
    "The undeserved envy of the Jews who crucified You* did not cease even when You were dead, О innocent Christ;* but the wicked ones slandered You as a liar and asked Pilate to guard Your tomb.* О what incurable wrath!"

    "Lifting up his arms in the form of the Cross on the mountain, Moses vanquished Amalek;* and You, О Saviour, stretched out upon the precious Cross, embraced me,* saving me from slavery to the enemy,* and gave it to me as the sign of life,* enabling me to evade the arrows of my adversaries.* Wherefore, О Word, I bow down before Your precious Cross.",
    "Great is the power of Your Cross!* For it was planted in one place, yet works throughout the world;* and it made apostles of fishermen and martyrs of the heathen,* that they might pray on behalf of our souls.",
