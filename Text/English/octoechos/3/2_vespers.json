    "3, Podoben “In crosswise manner...”",
    "Perceiving in me a slothfulness toward profitable works,* the serpent of many shapes transforms itself,* luring me towards ever more bitter evils,* showing me the sweetness of sin,* by his own bitter activity,* which is opposed to the commandments of God.* And taking advantage of my wicked character,* forcing me to accept evils as good.",
    "Having eagerly trodden the whole path of iniquity and sin,* and utterly departed from that which is straight,* I have now drawn nigh to the gates of death;* and, hemmed in, I cry aloud: О my supremely good Jesus, O path of our life,* turn me to the broad expanse of true repentance;* save and grant me correction;* and before my death, grant me divine forgiveness!",
    "I have been slain by diverse sins, by multitudes of transgressions and great misdeeds;* and I lie dead, truly helpless.* Only my hope in Your tender compassion remains alive, О Christ,* who grants both breath and life to the dead and slays the passions which kill us.* Wherefore, going before me, rescue me from everlasting death."

    "Save me, O Lord my God for You are the salvation of all:* The storm of the passions disquiets me,* and the yoke of my transgressions weighs heavily upon me.* Stretch out Your helping hand and lead me up to the light of compunction,* for You alone are compassionate and the Lover of mankind.",
    "Great is the power of Your martyrs, О Christ;* for while lying in their graves they drive evil spirits away;* and, having struggled for piety with their faith in the Trinity,* they abolished the authority of the enemy.",
