  "2": "О blessed Mary, divinely joyous Maiden, cloud of the never-waning Light:* Shine the light of repentance upon me who am mindlessly stuck fast in the darkness of sin;* and by your supplications deliver me* from the fire of Gehenna and the unremitting darkness, О most pure Virgin,* and show me to share in the never-setting day,* for I flee beneath your protection.",

  "5": "“Through Your crucifixion the world has found mercy, creation has been illumined,* and the nations have received salvation, О Master,” the most pure one cried;* “But I am now rent apart, beholding Your voluntary suffering.”"
