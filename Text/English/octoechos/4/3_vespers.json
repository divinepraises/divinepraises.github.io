    "Lifted up upon the Cross, pierced by a spear,* Your fingers bloodied, О supremely good Master, You signed our emancipation;* and tearing apart the record of the sins of Adam, our forefather,* You freed human nature.* О Compassionate One, we hymn Your goodness, which passes understanding.",
    "We hymn Your sufferings, О Jesus our Master:* the Cross, the spear and the reed, the sponge and the nails,* the beatings, the purple robe and the crown of thorns,* the spittings and mockery which You willingly endured.* I magnify Your long-suffering, О only Innocent One, Bestower of life,* and I glorify You with faith, О Lover of mankind.",
    "I bow down before Your precious Cross, kissing it with love, О Supremely good One,* and I glorify Your condescension, boundless mercy,* ineffable compassions and rich goodness, which pass understanding,* for thereby You have saved the race of mankind,* which was held fast in the darkness of transgressions.* Glory to Your crucifixion, О Christ!"
