    "When all creation beheld You crucified, it was changed and trembled:* the whole earth shook, quaking, О long-suffering Word;* in fear the veil of the temple rent in two* and in terror the rocks split asunder when You were insulted;* and the sun, knowing You to be its Creator, hid its rays.",
    "How did the most iniquitous council dare to condemn You, О immortal Judge,* who of old in the desert gave the law to Moses, who beheld God?* How could they fail to be filled with terror,* beholding the Life of all dead upon the Cross?* How could their mind not fathom that You are the one Lord and Master of creation?",
    "With the piercing of Your side, О greatly Merciful One,* the ancient record of our forefather Adam was rent asunder;* and by the shedding of Your blood rejected human nature was sanctified,* and cried aloud: Glory be to Your loving-kindness!* Glory be to Thy divine crucifixion,* О almighty Jesus, the Saviour of our souls!"
