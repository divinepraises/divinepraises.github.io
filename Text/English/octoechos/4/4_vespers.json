    "О glorious ones, who with a most mighty understanding* waged war, arraying yourselves against the wicked foe,* for having valiantly armed yourselves with the weaponry of the Spirit,* you destroyed all the might of the demons,* who seize men’s souls like plunder;* wherefore, we honour you throughout the ages, О apostles.",
    "Spreading out the net of the Faith in the form of the Cross,* Your twelve divine apostles dragged all the nations to the knowledge of You, О Christ,* and dried up the salty sea of the passions;* I beseech You: By their wholly well-pleasing supplications* recall me from the depths of transgressions.",
    "With divine hymns let the divinely chosen and all-honourable twelve apostles be praised:* Peter, Paul and James, Luke and John, Matthew and Thomas,* Mark, Simon and Philip, the most glorious Andrew and Matthias,* with the godly and most wise Bartholomew,* and the seventy others."
