    "Wash me with my tears, O Saviour,* for I have defiled myself with many sins;* therefore I fall down before You, crying:* I have sinned, O God! Have mercy on me!",
    "I am a sheep of Your spiritual flock,* and I hasten to You, the Good Shepherd.* Seek me out who am lost, O God, and have mercy of me.",
    "Who is not filled with, awe,* beholding the good fight which you fought, О holy martyrs:* how, though in the flesh, you vanquished the incorporeal foe,* confessing Christ and having armed yourselves with the Cross?* Because of this, you have befittingly shown yourselves to be expellers of the demons* and victors over the barbarians,* unceasingly praying that our souls be saved.",
    "gn",
    "O Godbearer! Queen of all, boast of the true believers:* Cast down the arrogance of the heretics,* and put them to shame who neither bow down before nor venerate your precious icon,* O all-pure One."
