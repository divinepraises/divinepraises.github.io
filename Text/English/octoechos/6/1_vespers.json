    "Through thought of contrition grant me tears of repentance, О Saviour,* that I may wash away the filth from my soul,* which I have badly sullied, committing unrighteousness all the time,* for it is for this that I have her who gave birth to You, and the angelic choirs,* entreating Your love for mankind.",
    "Come, О my soul, and repent of the many sins have committed in this life,* and entreat the multitude of the heavenly armies with sighs and tears,* that time be given you for repentance,* lest you be sent into the most accursed fire of Gehenna* like the barren fig-tree.",
    "Not one of Your commandments have I kept on earth.* When You shall sit upon Your throne, how shall I give answer for myself,* receiving condemnation for all that I have done in knowledge or in ignorance, О my Christ?* Wherefore, I cry out to You:* Through the supplications of Your servants save me, the prodigal!"

    "I have no repentance and I have no tears.* Wherefore I entreat You, O Christ God:* before the end is here* turn me back and grant me compunction,* that I may be delivered from the torments of Hades.",
