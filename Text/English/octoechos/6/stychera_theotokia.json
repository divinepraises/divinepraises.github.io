  "2": "О most holy Virgin, show forth upon me, the wretched one,* the depths of your love for mankind,* the abyss of your tender compassion, and the countless compassions of your goodness.* Mow down the stubble of sin, granting me chastity,* and preserve my body and soul undefiled,* О you who have given birth to the Saviour.",

  "5": "Seeing You nailed to the Tree, the most pure one cried out:* “O my Son and God, what is this exceedingly glorious and strange report of You,* that You endured in Your great mercy?”"
