    "As the Physician of souls and bodies, O Saviour,* Who grant forgiveness of offenses to those who ask,* heal the sores of my heart,* which have grown on me because of my many offenses;* grant me continuous tears of repentance and the forgiveness of my faults,* O Lord, and have mercy on me.",
    "All creation celebrates the memory of Your saints, O Lord:* the heavens rejoice with the angels, and the earth exults with men.* Through their supplications have mercy on us.",
