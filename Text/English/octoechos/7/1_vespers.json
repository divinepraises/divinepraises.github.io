    "Lift up your eyes, О my soul,* and behold the dispensation and tender compassion of God:* how having bowed down the heavens,* He descended to the earth,* that He might raise you up from the wretched state of your passions,* and set you upon the rock of faith.* О, the wonder of this awesome miracle!* Glory to Your abasement, О Lover of mankind!",
    "Behold your all-iniquitous works, О my soul,* and marvel that the earth still bears you, that it has not been driven asunder,* that the wild beasts do not devour you,* that the ever-shining Sun has not ceased to shine upon you.* Arise, repent, and cry out to the Lord:* I have sinned against You, I have sinned!* Have mercy on me!",
    "Trusting in You, О omnipotent Lord, we beseech You,* that we be delivered from all tribulations, sufferings, and turmoil;* that we may pass our life in peace;* and, having lived in purity, may find You, our Master,* merciful on the day of judgment."
