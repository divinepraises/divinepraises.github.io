    "Despising every earthly thing, O holy martyrs,* and bravely preaching Christ before the tribunal,* you received your reward from Him for your sufferings.* Since you have boldness before God,* we beseech you to pray to Him as one almighty,* that He save the souls of those who flee to you for help.",
    "O all-praised martyrs, you spiritual sheep,* living offerings and sacrifices acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.* You were not buried in the earth, yet heaven has received you;* O you who have become companions of the angels* we entreat you to pray with them to God our Saviour,* that peace be granted to the world, and that our souls be saved.",
    "In the beginning You formed man according to Your image and likeness,* and You made him dwell in Paradise as ruler over Your creation.* But through the envy of the devil he was deceived* and partook of the fruit, transgressing Your command.* Wherefore, O Lord, You have condemned him to return again to the earth* from whence he was taken,* and to ask of You a peaceful repose.",
