  "5": "The ewe-lamb, beholding her Lamb hastening to the slaughter,* followed quickly, crying out to Him these things:* To where do You go, O Jesus, my child most sweet?* To where, O Long-suffering One, do You run this rapid course so straight?* O sinless Jesus, greatly Desired One, most merciful Lord:* grant speech to me, Your handmaid.* O my compassionate Son most beloved,* pass me not by in silence who gave birth to You in strange manner.* O most compassionate God, grant great mercy to the world!"
