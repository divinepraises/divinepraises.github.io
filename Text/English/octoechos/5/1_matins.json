    "Overlook the multitude of my transgressions, O Lord,* Who was born of the Virgin;* and cleanse me of all my sins,* granting me the desire to convert,* for You alone love mankind.* I implore You: have mercy on me.",
    "Woe is me! To whom have I likened myself?* To the barren fig tree.* And I fear lest I be cursed and cut down.* But You, O Christ God, heavenly Gardener,* make my hardened heart fruitful,* accept me as You did the prodigal son,* and have mercy on me.",
    "Blessed is the army of the heavenly King:* for though the passion-bearers were born of this earth,* despising their bodies they made haste to attain to the angelic estate;* and through their sufferings were deemed worthy of the honour of the bodiless hosts.* By their prayers, O Lord, save our souls.",
    "gn",
    "O Full of grace, intercede with your prayers* and implore for our souls a multitude of graces and the cleansing of our many offenses;* we implore you."
