    "O martyrs of the Lord, you sanctify every place and heal every manner of infirmities:* and now we entreat you to intercede on our behalf* that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the enemy.",
    "Your martyrs, O Lord, having put aside the temporal things of this life,* despised not torture for the sake of the life to come,* therefore they rejoice with the angels.* By their supplications bestow upon Your people great mercy.",
    "If there be any virtue and if there be any praise,* rightly are these things ascribed to the saints.* Who for the sake of You who bowed the heavens and descend to us,* bowed their necks beneath the sword.* They shed their blood for You,* who emptied Yourself and take the form of a servant;* they humbled themselves even to death,* following the example of Your poverty.* By their prayers have mercy upon us, O God,* according to the multitude of Your tender mercies!"

    "I lament and weep whenever I see death* and look upon our beauty, fashioned according to God’s image,* lying in the grave disfigured and inglorious,* its outward form destroyed.* O strange wonder! What mystery is this that concerns us?* How have we been delivered over to corruption?* How have we been conjoined to death?* All this, so it is written, is by the ordinance of God,* who doth grant rest to the departed.",
    "Your death, O Lord, has enabled us to be immortal.* For had You not been laid in the tomb,* Paradise had not been opened.* Therefore grant rest to the departed* as You are the Lover of mankind.",
