    "When You were nailed to the Cross, Your hands and feet run through,* Your holy side was pierced, pouring forth drops of blood and water,* divine salvation, supremely good One,* that You might wash away my defilement and pollution.* Glory to Your goodness, О all-Compassionate One!",
    "You endured suffering, О Master,* that You might bestow dispassion upon all who worship Your sufferings and voluntary sacrifice:* the spear, nails and reed, which You willingly endured with long-suffering:* that for the sake of Your sufferings, О Lord, You might win dispassion for me.",
    "The unblemished heifer, beholding her Bullock willingly lifted up upon the Tree,* cried out with compunction, lamenting:* “Woe is me, О my most beloved Child!* How have the ungrateful assembly of the Jews rewarded You,* desiring to leave me bereft of You, О all-Beloved!”"

    "You were nailed to the Cross, О Christ God,* opening the gates of paradise.* We glorify Your divinity!",
    "Your martyrs, О Lord, were no longer mindful of the things of life,* but ignored their tortures for the sake of the life which is to come,* and were shown to be inheritors thereof;* therefore, they rejoice with the angels.* By their supplications grant great mercy to Your people.",
