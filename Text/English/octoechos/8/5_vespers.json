    "О most glorious wonder!* The Life-bearing Tree, the most holy Cross is revealed today, lifted up on high.* All the ends of the earth glorify it, and the hordes of the demons are affrighted.* О what a gift has been given to mortals!* Thereby, О Christ, save our souls, in that You alone are compassionate.",
    "О most glorious wonder!* Like a vine full of life, bearing the Most High,* the Cross is seen today uplifted from the earth.* Thereby have we all been drawn to God,* and death has been utterly slaughtered.* О most honoured Tree, whereby, glorifying Christ,* we have received the immortal sustenance which was in Eden!",
    "О the great goodness which You have for us, О good Jesus!* How did You abase Yourself, become a man,* and will to suffer, enduring the Cross and violent death for Your useless servants?* We offer the Cross to You as a worthy and divinely fitting gift;* and giving thanks, we, the faithful, glorify You."
