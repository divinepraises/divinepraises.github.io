    "О Lord who came into the world to call sinners to You,* and who accepted the thief, the publican and the harlot:* in Your love for mankind, О my Christ, call me also to You,* though I have sinned against You more than all others, and never repent.",
    "О Lord, who ordained publicans as pastors for Your Church,* and made a helper now of him who before was a persecutor:* By their supplications show me to be Your lamb, О Saviour,* and let me not, who am useless, fall prey to the alien one.",
    "Weep before the end, О my wretched and most vile soul,* and cleave to God, crying out to him with groans from the depths of your heart:* I have sinned against You, О Christ!* Revile me not, I pray,* but turning me back to You, grant me forgiveness,* in that You are merciful."
