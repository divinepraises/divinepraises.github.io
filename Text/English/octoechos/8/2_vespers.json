    "8, Podoben “O most glorious wonder…”",
    "I have acquired neither compunction, nor a wellspring of tears,* nor fervent confession, nor weeping which washes me clean, nor humility of heart;* I have been neither an emulator of the publican, nor of the harlot, nor of the prodigal son*. How, therefore, shall I find remission for my many sins?* But in the judgments which You know, save me, О Christ.",
    "I have made myself foreign to every commandment of God;* in every way I have neglected higher virtue;* I have mindlessly wasted my whole life in slothfulness;* and I have committed every unseemly and iniquitous act in fornication.* Wherefore, since You are compassionate, О Christ, have pity, and freely save me.",
    "In Your anger rebuke me not who am the work of Your hands,* and who with my foolish mind have torn myself away from goodness, О Lover of mankind,* and who in the abyss of Your ineffable compassion* was for my sake well-pleased to become like to me.* But through the supplications of Your ever-Virgin Mother, О Word,* grant me divine conversion, in that You are God."

Rejoice, divine table!* Rejoice, tabernacle! Rejoice, golden jar!* Rejoice, hope of all!"
