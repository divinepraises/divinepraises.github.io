    "You stretched forth Your most pure hands upon the Cross, О Christ,* summoning those who had departed far from You and settling them near Yourself;* wherefore, I pray to You: Unite me to You,* though I have been made captive by the passions,* and grant to me the repentance which washes away* all the defilement of the passions.",
    "You uplifted Your most pure hands upon the Tree, О Christ,* and bloodied Your fingers, desiring to deliver Adam, the work of Your divine hands,* who because of disobedience was held fast in the realm of death, О Lover of mankind;* and You raised him up by Your authority, О Almighty.",
    "You endured suffering for our sake, О Saviour* who are immutable by nature and dispassionate in Your divinity;* and You were crucified with thieves, О sinless and beginningless Christ.* The sun, unable to bear the audacity, dimmed its rays,* and the whole earth quaked, acknowledging You* to be the Creator of the world."

How is it that You die unjustly?* How is it that You who has suspended the whole earth upon the waters* hangs upon the Tree?* Leave me not alone who am Your Mother and handmaiden,* I pray, O greatly merciful Benefactor!”"
