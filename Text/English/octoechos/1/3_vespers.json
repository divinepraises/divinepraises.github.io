    "Nailed to the Cross as a man, О Christ God,* You deified human nature and slay the serpent, the author of evil.* Becoming accursed in that You are compassionate,* You freed us from the curse which has its origin in the tree.* And You came that You might give blessing* and great mercy to all.",
    "Though You are exalted far above all honour, О Master,* You deigned to be dishonoured, enduring a violent death upon the Tree,* that when You died in the flesh, О Almighty,* through it the race of mankind might embrace immortality* and receive again its primal life.",
    "О most precious Cross, purification of all the faithful,* sanctify all who bow down before you and glorify Christ,* who stretched out His most pure hands upon you in His ineffable loving-kindness,* and who has gathered together all the ends of the earth."

    "The Cross was set up on Golgotha,* and has blossomed forth immortality for us from the ever-flowing fountain* of the Saviour’s side.",
    "The precious Cross of the Saviour is for us an indestructible rampart;* for, placing our trust therein,* we all are saved.",
    "О how good was your barter, О saints!* For you traded your blood and inherited heavenly things;* and having undergone trials for a time, you rejoice everlastingly.* Of a truth your commerce was good!* For, having forsaken corruptible things, you received those things which were incorrupt;* and joining chorus with the angels, you unceasingly hymn* the consubstantial Trinity.",

    "Upon beholding the Lamb lifted up upon the Cross,* the immaculate Virgin cried aloud, weeping:* “O my Child most sweet, what is this new and most glorious sight?* How is it that You who hold all things in Your hand* have been nailed to the Tree in the flesh?”"
