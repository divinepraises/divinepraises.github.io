    "In Your goodness, О Lord,* You brought all things about by Your Word and Spirit,* and also created me a reason-endowed living thing,* that I might glorify Your omnipotent name.* But, more than any, I ever act dishonourably by my shameful deeds;* yet have pity on me, I pray.",
    "I recognize your divine nobility and the incorrupt homeland, О wretched soul,* and I ever strive to attain them by goodly deeds.* Let all that is corrupt never captivate me.* You are my higher part, while the body is earth and corrupts.* Let not what is baser overcome that which is higher.",
    "Go to the Supremely good One, О all-accursed soul;* approach Him with fervent tears;* before your condemnation confess all things that you have done;* and render your Creator merciful to you, О wretched one.* Beg forgiveness, lest the Lord shut the door to you."
