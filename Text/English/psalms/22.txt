The Lord is my shepherd;*
 there is nothing I shall want.•
Fresh and green are the pastures*
 where he gives me repose.•
Near restful waters he leads me;*
 he restores my soul.•
He guides me along the right path;*
 he is true to his name.•
If I should walk in the valley of darkness*
 no evil would I fear.•
 You are there with your crook and your staff;*
 with these you give me comfort.•
You have prepared a banquet for me*
 in the sight of my foes.•
My head you have anointed with oil;*
 my cup is overflowing.•
Your mercy, O Lord, shall follow me*
 all the days of my life.•
In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell*
 forever and ever.•
