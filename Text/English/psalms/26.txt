The Lord is my light and my help;*
 whom shall I fear?•
The Lord is the stronghold of my life;*
 before whom shall I shrink?•
When evil-doers draw near to devour my flesh,*
 it is they, my enemies and foes, who stumble and fall.•
Though an army encamp against me*
 my heart would not fear.•
Though war break out against me,*
 even then would I trust.•
There is one thing I ask of the Lord, for this I long,*
 to live in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life,•
to savor the sweetness of the Lord,*
 to behold his temple.•
For there he keeps me safe in his tent*
 in the day of evil.•
He hides me in the shelter of his tent,*
 on a rock he sets me safe.•
And now my head shall be raised*
 above my foes who surround me•
and I shall offer within his tent*
 a sacrifice of joy.•
I will sing and make music for the Lord.*
 O Lord, hear my voice when I call; have mercy and answer.•
Of you my heart has spoken:*
 “Seek his face.”•
It is your face, O Lord, that I seek;*
 hide not your face.•
Dismiss not your servant in anger;*
 you have been my help.•
Do not abandon or forsake me,*
 O God my help!•
Though father and mother forsake me,*
 the Lord will receive me.•
Instruct me, Lord, in your way;*
 on an even path lead me.•
When they lie in ambush protect me*
 from my enemy’s greed.•
False witnesses rise against me,*
 breathing out fury.•
I am sure I shall see the Lord’s goodness*
 in the land of the living.•
Hope in the Lord, hold firm and take heart.*
 Hope in the Lord!•
