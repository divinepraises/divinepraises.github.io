How beloved are Your dwellings, O Lord of hosts;* my soul longs and pines for the courts of the Lord. ● My heart and my flesh have rejoiced* in the living God. ● Even the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself,* where she will lay her young: ● Your altars, O Lord of hosts,* my King and my God. ● Blessed are those who dwell in Your house,* they will praise You for ever and ever. ● Blessed is the man whose help is from You;* with Your help he was able to surmount his grief. ● For the lawgiver will indeed give blessings;* they will go from strength to strength.* The God of gods will appear in Sion. ● Hear my prayer, O Lord God of hosts;* give ear, O God of Jacob. ● See, O God our shield;* and look on the face of Your anointed. ● For one day in Your courts* is better than a thousand elsewhere. ● I have chosen to be cast aside in the house of my God,* rather than dwell in the tents of sinners. ● For the Lord loves mercy and truth.* God will give the grace and the glory. ● He will not deprive those who walk in innocence* of any good thing. ● O Lord God of hosts,* blessed is the man who hopes in You. ●
