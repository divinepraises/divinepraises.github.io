The Lord said to my Lord:* Sit at my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool.• The Lord will yield from Zion your scepter of power:* rule in the midst of all your foes.• A prince from the day of your birth on the holy mountains;* from the womb, before the morning star, I have begotten you.• The Lord has sworn and he will not repent.* "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."• The Master standing at your right hand* will shatter kings in the day of his wrath.• He, the judge of the nations will heap high the bodies;* heads shall be scattered far and wide.• He shall drink from the stream by the wayside* and therefore he shall lift up his head.•
