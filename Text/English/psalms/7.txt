O Lord my God, I have hoped in You:* save me from my pursuers and deliver me,• Lest the enemy as a lion seize my soul,* while there is none to ransom or save me.• O Lord my God, if I have done this,* if there is injustice on my hands,• If 1 have returned evil to those who wronged me,* may I fall exhausted at the hand of my foes.• May the enemy then hunt down my soul* and seize it;• May he trample my life to the ground* and grind my honor to dust.• Arise, O Lord, in Your anger* be exalted in my foes’ remotest lands:• Awake, O Lord my God* in Your commanding will.• And the assembly of peoples shall surround You,* and You will regard it from on high.• The Lord is the judge of nations:* judge me, O Lord, according to my merit, and to the innocence that is mine.• Put an end to the malice of the wicked* and sustain the just, O God Who test minds and hearts.• Rightful is my help from God* Who saves the upright of heart.• God the just judge, strong and patient,* does not show His anger every day.• If you do not repent, He will furbish his sword.* He has bent His bow and made it ready.• He has fitted it with implements of death;* His arrows will bring fiery ruin.• Behold the sinner in his wickedness:* he conceived in pain and brought forth iniquity;• He opened a pit, and covered it up;* he shall fall into the very hole he dug.• The evil he wrought shall return upon his head,* and the wrongs he has done, upon his skull.• I will give thanks to the Lord* According to His justice• And sing praise to the name* of the Lord most high.•
