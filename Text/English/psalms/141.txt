With my voice I cried to the Lord;* with all my voice I implored the Lord.• Before Him I pour out my supplications;* before Him I declare my distress.• When my breath was escaping me,* then You knew my paths;• On the road upon which I was walking,* they set up snares for me.• I looked to my right and observed* there was no one friendly to me;• Even flight was denied me;* there was no one to take care of my life.• I cried out to You, O Lord, and said:* You are my hope, my share in the land of the living.• Listen to my supplication,* for I am laid very low.• Deliver me from my oppressors,* for they have overwhelmed me.• Lead my soul forth from prison* that I may give thanks to Your name.• The just shall gather around me* when You have been good to me.•
