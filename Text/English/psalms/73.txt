Why, O God, have you cast us off forever?*
 Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?•
Remember your flock which you acquired long ago,
 the tribe you redeemed to be your own possession,*
 the mountain of Zion where you made your dwelling.•
Turn your steps to these places that are utterly ruined!*
 The enemy has laid waste the whole of the sanctuary.•
Your foes have made uproar in your house of prayer:*
they have set up their emblems, their foreign emblems,
 high above the entrance to the sanctuary.•
Their axes have battered the wood of its doors.*
 They have struck together with hatchet and pickax.•
O God, they have set your sanctuary on fire;*
 they have razed and profaned the place where you dwell.•
They said in their hearts: “Let us utterly crush them;*
 let us burn every shrine of God in the land.”•
There is no sign from God, nor have we a prophet,*
 we have no one to tell us how long it will last.•
How long, O God, is the enemy to scoff?*
 Is the foe to insult your name forever?•
Why, O Lord, do you hold back your hand?*
 Why do you keep your right hand hidden?•
Yet God is our king from all ages.*
 He has accomplished salvation in the middle of the earth.•
It was you who divided the sea by your might,*
 who shattered the heads of the monsters in the sea.•
It was you who crushed Leviathan’s heads*
 and gave him as food to the untamed beasts.•
It was you opened springs and torrents;*
 it was you who dried up ever-flowing rivers.•
Yours is the day and yours is the night.*
 It was you who appointed the light and the sun;•
it was you who fixed the bounds of the earth:*
 you who made both summer and winter.•
Remember this, Lord, and see the enemy scoffing;*
 a senseless people insults your name.•
Do not give Israel, your dove, to the hawk*
 nor forget the life of your poor ones forever.•
Remember your covenant; every cave in the land*
 is a place where violence makes its home.•
Do not let the oppressed return disappointed;*
 let the poor and the needy bless your name.•
Arise, O God, and defend your cause!*
 Remember how the senseless revile you all the day.•
Do not forget the clamor of your foes,*
 the daily increasing uproar of your foes.•
