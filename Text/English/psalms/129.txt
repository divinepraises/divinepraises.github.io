Out of the depths I cry to You, O Lord;* O Lord, hear my voice!• Let Yours ears be attentive* to the voice of my prayer.• If You mark iniquities, Lord, who can stand?* But with You forgiveness is that You may be revered.• I have waited for You as You have commanded; my soul patiently relies on Your promise,* for it has trusted in the Lord.• From the morning watch until night* let Israel trust in the Lord.• For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plentiful redemption;* and He shall redeem Israel from all its iniquities.•
