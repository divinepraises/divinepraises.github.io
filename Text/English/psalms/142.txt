Lord, listen to my prayer:* turn your ear to my appeal.• You are faithful, you are just; give answer.* Do not call your servant to judgment• for no one is just in your sight.* The enemy pursues my soul;• he has crushed my life to the ground;* he has made me dwell in darkness• like the dead, long forgotten.* Therefore my spirit fails;• my heart is numb within me.* I remember the days that are past:• I ponder all your works.* I muse on what your hand has wrought• and to you I stretch out my hands.* Like a parched land my soul thirsts for you.• Lord, make haste and answer;* for my spirit fails within me.• Do not hide your face* lest I become like those in the grave.• In the morning let me know your love* for I put my trust in you.• Make me know the way I should walk:* to you I lift up my soul.• Rescue me, Lord, from my enemies;* I have fled to you for refuge.• Teach me to do your will* for you, O Lord, are my God.• Let your good spirit guide me* in ways that are level and smooth.• For your nameʼs sake, Lord, save my life; in your justice save my soul from distress.* In your love make an end of my foes;• destroy all those who oppress me* for I am your servant, O Lord.•
