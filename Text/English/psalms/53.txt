O God, save me by Your name;* vindicate me by Your power.• O God, hear my prayer,* give ear to the words I speak.• For strangers have risen against me and the powerful have sought my soul;* they have not put God before them.• Behold, God will help me,* and the Lord is the protector of my life.• He will turn evils upon my foes;* with Your truth destroy them, Lord.• Willingly I shall sacrifice to You,* I shall confess Your name, O Lord, for it is good.• For You have delivered me from every tribulation,* and my eyes have looked down on my foes.•
