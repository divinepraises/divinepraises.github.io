Lord, remember David and all his humility,* how he swore to the Lord and vowed to the God of Jacob.• “I will not enter the house where I live* nor go to the bed where I rest.• I will give no sleep to my eyes, to my eyelids I will give no slumber* till I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Strong One of Jacob.”• At Ephrata we heard of the ark;* we found it in the plains of Yearim.• “Let us go to the place of his dwelling;* let us go to kneel at his footstool.”• Go up, Lord, to your rest,* you and your holy ark.• Your priests will be clothed with righteousness* and your saints will rejoice.• For the sake of David your servant* do not reject your anointed.• The Lord swore a true oath to David;* he will not go back on his word:• “A son, the fruit of your body,* will I set upon your throne.• If they keep my covenant in truth* and my laws that I have taught them,• Their sons also shall rule* on your throne from age to age.”• For the Lord has chosen Zion;* he prefers her for his dwelling:• “This is my resting-place forever,* here have I chosen to live.• I will greatly bless her produce,* I will fill her poor with bread.• I will clothe her priests with salvation* and your saints will rejoice.• There David’s stock will flower;* I will prepare a lamp for my anointed.• I will cover his enemies with shame* but on him my crown will shine.”•
