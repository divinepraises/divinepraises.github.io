He who lives by the help of the Most High,* will dwell in the shelter of the God of heaven. • He will say to the Lord: “My protector, my refuge,* my God, in Whom I trust.”• For He will deliver you from the snare of hunters,* and from the troubling word.• He will shade you with His shoulders, and beneath His wings you will hope;* like a shield His truth will encircle you.• You will not fear terror by night,* nor the arrow that flies by day;• nor the thing that prowls in the darkness,* nor mishap and the noonday devil.• A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right,* but it will not come near you.• With your eyes you will observe,* and see the reward of sinners.• For You, Lord, are my hope:* You have made the Most High your refuge.• Evils will not approach you,* nor a scourge draw near your dwelling.• For He has commanded His angels* to guard you in all your ways.• They will bear you on their hands,* lest you dash your foot against a stone.• You will tread on asp and cobra,* and trample down lion and dragon.• “Because he hoped in Me, I shall deliver him;* I will shelter him, because he knew My name.• He will cry to Me, and I will hear him,* I am with him in trouble;• I shall rescue and glorify him.* With length of days I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.”•
