Of mercy and justice I will sing to You, Lord, I will sing and reflect on a blameless way;* when will You come to me?• I have walked within my house* in innocence of heart.• I have set no lawless deed before my eyes;* I have hated those who do wrong.• No twisted heart has cleaved to me;* the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged.• The one who secretly slanders his neighbor,* him I have banished.• With a man of proud looks and insatiate heart,* I have not eaten.• I look with favor on the faithful in the land,* that they might dwell with me;• the man who walks on a blameless path,* he has served me.• The one who acts proudly has not dwelt in my house;* the one who speaks lies has not prospered in my sight.• Morning by morning I slew all the sinners in the land,* to purge from the Lord’s city all who work iniquity.•
