Lord, our God, how wonderful Your name* in all the earth,• For Your excellence has been exalted* above the heavens,• From the mouth of babes and sucklings,* You have fashioned perfect praise• Because of Your enemies,* to silence the hostile and the vengeful,• For I will look upon the work of Your fingers,* the moon and the stars You have established.• What is man,* that You should be mindful of him,• Or the son of man,* that You should have regard for him?• You have made him a little lower than the angels,* crowning him with glory and honor.• And you have set him over the works of Your hands;* You have put all things under his feet,• All of the sheep and oxen,* yea, even the beasts of the field,• The birds of the sky and the fishes of the sea,* and all that moves along ocean pathways.• Lord, our Lord,* how wonderful Your name in all the earth!•
