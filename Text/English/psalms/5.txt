Give ear to my words, O Lord,* understand my cry.• Be attentive to the sound of my plea,* O my King and my God;• for to You I shall pray, O Lord.* In the morning You will hear my voice.• In the morning I shall stand before You,* and You will watch over me.• For You are not a God who desires iniquity.* The evildoer will not dwell with You,• nor will the lawless remain in Your sight.* You have hated all who work evil;• You will destroy all who speak lies.* The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit.•  As for me, because of the abundance of Your mercy* I will come into Your house;• I will bow in worship towards Your holy temple,* in fear of You.• Conduct me, O Lord, in Your justice;* because of my enemies, direct my way in Your sight.• For there is no truth in their mouth;* their heart is vain.• Their throat is an open sepulchre;* they deal deceitfully with their tongues.• Judge them, O God,* that they may fall from their devices;• according to the multitude of their offences, cast them out,* for they have bitterly provoked You, O Lord.• But let those be glad who hope in You;* they shall rejoice forever, and You shall dwell in them.• And all those who love Your name* shall glory in You.• For You will bless the just, O Lord.* You have crowned us with a shield of Your good will.•
