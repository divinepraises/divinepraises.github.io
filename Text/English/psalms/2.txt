Why did the Gentiles grow insolent and the people practice vain things? The kings of the earth stood side by side, the princes conspired against the Lord and against His anointed one. “Let us burst their bonds and throw off their yoke,” they said. He who dwells in the heavens will laugh them down; the Lord will make light of them. But then in His anger He will speak to them, and in His wrath, strike terror in them: “It is I who was established king by Him on Sion, His holy mountain.” Proclaiming the Lord’s command The Lord said to me: “You are My son; today I have begotten You.” Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations as Your lot, and the ends of the earth as Your domain. You will shepherd them with an iron staff: like a potter’s vessels You wilt shatter them.” And now, you kings, take notice; be informed, you who judge the earth. <b>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling.</b> Accept His censure, lest the Lord be angry and you perish from the way of righteousness. When His wrath is suddenly kindled, <b>blessed are those who trust in Him</b>.
