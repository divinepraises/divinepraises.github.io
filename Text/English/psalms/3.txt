O Lord, who do so many taunt me? Many are those who rise up against me; Many who say to me,
“There is no salvation from him in his God.” But You, O Lord, are a shield around me, my glory: the one who
lifts up my head. I cried out to the Lord in a loud voice, and from His holy mountain He heard me. As for me, I
lay down and slept. Then I awoke, for the Lord will be my help. I will not fear ten thousand people arrayed
against me all around. <b>Arise, O Lord, save me, my God!</b>  For You have stricken all who hated me without cause; You have shattered the sinners’ teeth. <b>Salvation is of the Lord; upon Your people Your blessing!</b>
