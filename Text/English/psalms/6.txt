O Lord, in Your anger, rebuke me not,* chasten me not in Your wrath;• Have pity on me, O Lord, for I am weak;* heal me. O Lord, for my very bones are troubled.• And my soul is upset exceedingly.* But You, O Lord, how long?• Relent, O Lord, and free my soul;* out of Your great love deliver me.• For in death no one remembers You,* and in Hades, who will sing Your praise?• I am exhausted with my moaning:* shall I weep every night upon my bed and drench my couch with tears?• My eyes are sore with weeping,* I am worn out because of all my foes.• Begone from me, all you evildoers,* for the Lord has heard the sound of my lament.• The Lord has heeded my appeal,* the Lord has acceded to my prayer.• Let all my foes be greatly shamed and vexed,* Let them be swiftly routed and mightily cast down.•
