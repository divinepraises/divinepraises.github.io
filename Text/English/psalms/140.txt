O Lord, I have cried to You, hear me.* Receive the voice of my prayer when I call upon You.• Let my prayer rise like incense before You,* and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.• Set a guard, O Lord, before my mouth* and a portal around my lips.• Incline my heart away from evil dealings,* from finding excuses for sinful deeds.• In company with those who work iniquity,* let me not partake of what they choose.• May the just chasten me with justice and reprove me;* may the oil of the wicked never touch my head.• Yet even then shall I pray for their welfare.* Their rulers were swallowed near the rock.• My words will be heard, for they were sweet.* As a lump of clay broken on the ground,* so their bones were strewn near the grave.• On You, Lord, O Lord, my eyes are fixed.* In You have I trusted; take not my life.• Keep me from the snare that was set for me,* and from the stumbling-blocks of the wicked.• The wicked shall fall into their own nets,* while I remain alone until I can escape.•
