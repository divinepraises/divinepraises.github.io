How long, O Lord, will You forget me?* How long will You hide Your face?• How long must I bear grief in my soul,* this sorrow in my heart day and night?• How long shall my enemy prevail?* Look at me, answer me, Lord my God!• Give light to my eyes* lest I fall asleep in death,• Lest my enemy say:* I have overcome him;• Let my foes rejoice* to see my fall.• As for me, I trust in Your merciful love.* Let my heart rejoice in Your saving help:• Let me sing to the Lord for His goodness to me* singing psalms to the name of the Lord, the Most High.•
