Bring to the Lord, you sons of God;*
 bring to the Lord glory and honor;•
give the Lord the glory of his name.*
 Adore the Lord in his holy court.•
The voice of the Lord over the waters;*
 the God of glory thunders; the Lord over many waters.•
The voice of the Lord, full of power,*
 the voice of the Lord, full of splendor.•
The Lord’s voice shattering the cedars,*
 the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon;•
he makes Lebanon leap like a calf*
 and Sirion like a young wild ox.•
The Lord’s voice*
 flashes flames of fire.•
The Lord’s voice shaking the wilderness,*
 the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh;•
the Lord’s voice rending the oak tree*
 and stripping the forest bare.•
In his temple they all cry: “Glory!”*
 The Lord sat enthroned over the flood;
 the Lord sits as king forever.•
The Lord will give strength to his people;*
the Lord will bless his people with peace.•
