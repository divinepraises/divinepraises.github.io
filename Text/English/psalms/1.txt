<b>Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked.</b> Nor taken the path of the sinful, nor sat among pernicious men, But who delights in the law of the Lord, and will meditate on His law day and night. He shall be as tree that is planted near running water, That shall yield its fruit in due season, and its leaves shall not fall. And in whatever he does he shall prosper. Not so the wicked, not so: They are like chaff scattered by the wind from the face of the earth. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners in the councils of the just; <b>For the Lord knows the way of the just, but the way of the wicked shall be lost.</b>
