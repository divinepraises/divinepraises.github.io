The Lord reigns, he is clothed in majesty;*
 robed is the Lord and girt about with strength.•
The world he made firm, not to be moved;*
 your throne has stood from of old.•
You are, O Lord,*
 from all eternity.•
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord,
 the rivers have lifted up their voice;*
 the rivers will lift up their waves.•
Greater than the roar of mighty waters,
more glorious than the surgings of the sea,*
 the Lord is glorious on high.•
Your decrees are worthy of trust indeed;*
 holiness is fitting to your house, O Lord,
 until the end of time.•
