<h1>About the project</h1>
<p>
    This is an attempt at making a script that compiles divine praises.
</p>
<p>
    It is planned to be consistent with the
    Galician/Catholic Kyivan version of Slavic-Byzantine rite, and with the resources available in Canada.
    The plan is to allow switching between different versions later, but so far to focus on this one.
</p>
<h1>Plan</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
      <b>POC stage</b>. Get the basic structure for every hour but matins in a priest-less mode.
      At this stage the translations will be sources from different places
      (which will be documented).
      Over-reliance on the common menaion and is expected at this stage.
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>Filling the gaps stage.</b>
      At this point I expect to get my hands on a steady source of texts,
      and have everything in a consistent translation.
      And make the interface less awkward.
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>Letting it go.</b> Allow to switch between translations, versions etc
      and start accepting open-source contributions.
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
      <b>Horologion</b> The general texts are found on internet and are selected to match "The Divine Liturgy: An Anthology for Worship", Ottawa 2004. (referred to as "the Anthology" in what follows)<br>
      The compline troparia are taken from the "Divine Office", Stamford, CT, USA, 2014 (referred to as "English vasylianka" in what follows).<br>
      The Sunday hypakoe are taken from Royal doors.<br>
      The lenten troparia are taken from a brochure "Little hours for weekdays of Lent" by Cyrill Kennedy, that itself relies on "The Lenten Triodion" published by the Sisters of St. Basil in Uniontown, Pennsylvania.<br>
      The lesser doxology is adapted from Matins booklet from Ottawa, and the missing parts are taken from the vespers book from Ottawa.<br>
      The two longest prayers of the small compline are from Metropolitan Cantor Institute (MCI) version of Compline<br>
      Curiously, MCI edition omits the two shorter compline prayers, so they are taken from the English vasylianka.<br>
      The penitential prayer after compline without priest was taken from MCI Typica.<br>
      The prayer after it was translated from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RpNY3FDh73OHi1Cu1vXA3KzBCeLZ-U_U/view">a Lviv chasoslov of 1900</a> relying on some orthodox translations of similar prayers.<br>
      The prayers after compline with a priest are a mix of English Vasylianka and MCI versions.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>Psalms</b> are not aligned yet, as this is a POC.<br>
      Texts of psalms in the Little hours are selected to match the Anthology.<br>
      Psalms of the first kathisma are taken from the vespers booklet printed in Ottawa. They are reused for Great Compline.<br>
      Rest of the psalms of the Compline are taken from the English vasylianka.
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>Octoechos.</b> Canons for Compline are taken from <a href="https://st-sergius.org/">a website of St. Sergius of Radonezh Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Parma, Ohio.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>Proper texts.</b> Amazing <a href="https://liturgy.royaldoors.net/">Royal doors.</a><br>
      Stycheras for st. Theodore Studite, Lytia for st. Apostle Andrew, Aposticha for bl. Josaphata are translated by myself.

<h2>Rubrics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4vzPDufLbhuMEstN1pSU2ZzVG8/edit?usp=sharing">Dolnytsky's Typicon</a>
      with Устав Богослужінь (link to a text in Ukrainian).
  </li>
  <li>
      There are (almost) no rubrics for a <b>laymen's/reader's office</b> in Byzantine rite books, so each local tradition
      found its own approaches.
      I rely on
      <a href="https://samstar-biblio.ucoz.ru/load/arsenij_uralskij_kratkij_ustav/153-1-0-935">Small Typicon by Arseny of Uralsk</a>
      (link to download a pdf in Church Slavonic).
      It represents priest-accepting old-believer tradition, that seems to be the closest
      tradition to UGCC that has a full set of relevant rubrics (in English internet there exists another set of rubrics,
      popularized by a ROCOR bishop but tracing back to priest-denying old-believers of Vyg).
      I looked through the horologions scanned as a part of the "Digitalized tradition" project, and those published by Lviv brotherhood
      sometimes have some more elaborate indications for laymen, but they are not consistent.
      E.g. <a href="http://dds.edu.ua/ua/articles/2/digitalized-tradition/book/1-liturgical-books/114-Chasoslov.html">1726 Lviv brotherhood horologion</a>
      suggests the same approach to dismissals as Arseny of Uralsk (changing priest's affirmative dismissal into a petition)
      in Midnight prayer, but the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RpNY3FDh73OHi1Cu1vXA3KzBCeLZ-U_U/view">1900 version</a> that gives an indication to replace ektenias by sets of "Lord have mercy" in a couple places,
      completely ignores dismissals.
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>Rubrics on shortening</b> of the office are taken from
      <a href="http://dds.edu.ua/ua/component/abook/book/3-canon-law/11-sobor-lviv-1891-dodatok.html">The appendix to the decisions of Lviv synod of 1891</a>
      (the document's language is Iazychie (i think?? why???!!!);
      shortenings are described in Appendix XXX, at page 392 of the text/359 of the pdf).
      Here is a brief summary:
      <ul>
        <li>
            Vespers: one out of 8 priestly prayers can be said, according to the tone of the week.
        </li>
        <li>
            Small Compline: on weekdays, one psalm is said, according to the day of the week, and the doxology (Glory to God in the highest) is omitted.
            On Sundays (Saturday night) psalms are omitted and only the doxology is said.
            If a canon is prescribed, only 2 odes are said:
            one out the 7 first odes, according to the day of the week, and the 9th.
        </li>
        <li>
            Midnight prayer: one out 3 stases of the kathisma is said, in order.
            On Sundays, only one ode of the canon is said, according to the tone
            (ode 1 if the week is of the 1st tone, ode <i>n+1</i> for any tone <i>n>1</i>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Matins: one out of two psalms of the royal office is said, in turns.
            One out of 6 psalms of The Six Psalms is said, according to the day of the week (the 6th one is said on both Saturday and Sunday).
            One out of 11 priestly prayers can be said, according to the Sunday Matins Gospel of the week.
            Canons are said as at compline.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hours: one out 3 psalms is said, according to the day of the week (the 3rd one is said on both Saturday and Sunday).
        </li>
      </ul>
      Note, that there are no provisions to shorten kathismata or omit canons. There is still an option to do that in this
      project, as it is often done in practice.<br>
      Устав богослужінь (the 1980 update to the Dolnytsky Typicon) includes recommended shortenings for Matins too.
  </li>
  <li>
      A honorable mention goes to the Basilian Molytvoslov (Vasylianka).
      It was a great tool to propagate the Divine Praises in pre-internet times,
      but let's try to live our tradition as if Vasylianka never existed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ukrainian app for the same (but it's manually compiled): <a href="https://prayer-service.pp.ua/">МОЛИТВА ЦЕРКВИ</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Latin app that contain lots of versions of the Office.  <a href="https://www.divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/horas/officium.pl">Divinum Officium</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Chant resources</h2>
This is not planned as a chant resource. There is a very comprehensive
<a href="https://ugccmusic.com/music-resources"> resources page</a> for Galician and Kyivan chant maintained by Singcon conference.
For chant in the Ruthenian (in a sense of Transcarpathian, not pre-1839 UGCC) chant tradition, there is
<a href="https://mci.archpitt.org/MCI/index.html">The Metropolitan Cantor Institute</a>.<br>
In this project, however, the tones of troparia, sticheras etc are indicated. If a tone is not indicated, it can be a mistake,
please report it in private communication.
